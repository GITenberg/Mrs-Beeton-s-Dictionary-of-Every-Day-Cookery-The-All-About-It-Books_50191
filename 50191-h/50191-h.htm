<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="hang1">

<i>The reasons for the publication of this Volume—the First of a Series of
Practical Manuals which were to be called the “All About It” Books—were
thus explained in a Prospectus issued a few months ago, and
approved by the late</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">S. O. Beeton</span>:—</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="58" height="58" alt="M" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">MANY wishes have been expressed to the Authoress
of the “Book of Household Management” that
a volume of Recipes in Cookery should be written
which could be sold at a price somewhere between
the seven-and-sixpenny “Household Management” and the
Shilling Cookery Book. Accordingly Mrs. <span class="smcap">Beeton</span> has prepared
a Collection of Recipes, and of other Practical Information
concerning the Dressing and Serving of Family Fare,
which, when completed, will be published, in serviceable
binding, at the price of Three Shillings and Sixpence.</p>

<p>As Mistress, Cook, and Critic have declared that the
details in Mrs. <span class="smcap">Beeton’s</span> larger work are <i>so easy to understand</i>,
the Authoress has followed, in every Recipe printed in the
present Dictionary, the same simple plan she originally used.
Regarding, however, the <i>arrangement</i> of the Recipes, the
Authoress has chosen the Dictionary form, believing an
alphabetical arrangement to be the best for a book that is
being constantly referred to. By the adoption of a very
intelligible system, all <i>cross</i> reference, and that very disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
parenthesis (<i>See</i> So-and-so) is avoided, except in a
very few instances. Where any warning as to what should
<i>not</i> be done is likely to be needed, it is given, as well as
advice as to what ought to be done. No pains have been
thought too great to make <i>little things</i> clearly understood.
Trifles constitute perfection. It is just the knowledge or
ignorance of little things that usually makes the difference
between the success of the careful and experienced housewife
or servant, and the failure of her who is careless and inexperienced.
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Beeton</span> has brought to her new offering
to the Public a most anxious care to describe plainly and
fully all the more difficult and recondite portions of Cookery,
whilst the smallest items have not been “unconsidered
trifles,” but each Recipe and preparation have claimed minute
attention.</p>

<h3>ALMOND CAKE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of sweet almonds,
1 oz. of bitter almonds, 6 eggs, 8 tablespoonfuls
of sifted sugar, 5 tablespoonfuls
of fine flour, the grated rind of
1 lemon, 3 oz. of butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch
and pound the almonds to a paste;
separate the whites from the yolks of
the eggs; beat the latter, and add them
to the almonds. Stir in the sugar, flour,
and lemon-rind; add the butter, which
should be beaten to a cream; and, when
all these ingredients are well mixed, put
in the whites of the eggs, which should
be whisked to a stiff froth. Butter a
cake-mould, put in the mixture, and bake
in a good oven from 1¼ to 1¾ hour. <i>Time.</i>—1¼
to 1¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>ALMOND CHEESECAKES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of sweet almonds,
4 bitter ones, 3 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, the
rind of ¼ lemon, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice,
3 oz. of sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch
and pound the almonds smoothly in a
mortar, with a little rose or spring
water; stir in the eggs, which should be
well beaten, and the butter, which should
be warmed; add the grated lemon-peel
and juice, sweeten, and stir well until
the whole is thoroughly mixed. Line
some patty-pans with puff-paste, put in
the mixture, and bake for 20 minutes, or
rather less, in a quick oven. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes, or rather less. <i>Average cost</i>,
10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for about 12 cheesecakes.</p>


<h3>ALMOND PASTE, for Second-Course
Dishes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of sweet almonds,
6 bitter ones, 1 lb. of very finely-sifted
sugar, the whites of 2 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch
the almonds, and dry them
thoroughly; put them into a mortar, and
pound them well, wetting them gradually
with the whites of 2 eggs. When well
pounded, put them into a small preserving-pan,
add the sugar, and place
the pan on a small but clear fire (a hot
plate is better); keep stirring until the
paste is dry, then take it out of the pan,
put it between two dishes, and, when
cold, make it into any shape that fancy
may dictate. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for the above quantity.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 3 small dishes of pastry.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>ALMOND PUDDING, Baked (very
rich).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of almonds, 4 bitter
ditto, 1 glass of sherry, 4 eggs, the rind
and juice of ½ lemon, 3 oz. of butter,
1 pint of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch and pound the
almonds to a smooth paste with the
water; mix these with the butter, which
should be melted; beat up the eggs,
grate the lemon-rind, and strain the
juice; add these, with the cream, sugar,
and wine, to the other ingredients, and
stir them well together. When well
mixed, put it into a pie-dish lined with
puff-paste, and bake for ½ hour. To
make this pudding more economically,
substitute milk for the cream; but then
add rather more than 1 oz. of finely-grated
bread. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i>, with cream at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per pint. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>ALMOND PUDDINGS, Small.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of sweet almonds,
6 bitter ones, ¼ lb. of butter, 4 eggs,
2 tablespoonfuls of sifted sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls
of cream, 1 tablespoonful of
brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch and pound the
almonds to a smooth paste with a spoonful
of water; warm the butter, mix the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
almonds with this, and add the other
ingredients, leaving out the whites of
2 eggs, and
be particular
that these are
well beaten.

minutes to ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<h3>ALMOND PUFFS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 tablespoonfuls of flour,
2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of pounded sugar,
2 oz. of sweet almonds, 4 bitter almonds.
<i>Mode.</i>—Blanch and pound the almonds
in a mortar to a smooth paste; melt the
butter, dredge in the flour, and add the
sugar and pounded almonds. Beat the
mixture well, and put it into cups or very
tiny jelly-pots, which should be well
buttered, and bake in a moderate oven
for about 20 minutes, or longer, should
the puffs be large. Turn them out on a
dish, the bottom of the puff uppermost,
and serve. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 2 or 3 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>ALMOND SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 lbs. of lean beef or
veal, a few vegetables as for Stock (<i>see</i>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#STOCKS">Stock</a></span>), 1 oz. of vermicelli, 4 blades of
mace, 6 cloves, ½ lb. of sweet almonds,
the yolks of 6 eggs, 1 gill of thick
cream, rather more than 3 quarts of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the beef or veal,
vegetables, and spices gently in water
that will cover them, till the gravy is
very strong, and the meat very tender;
than strain off the gravy, and set it on
the fire with the specified quantity of
vermicelli to 2 quarts. Let it boil till
sufficiently cooked. Have ready the
almonds, blanched and pounded very
fine; the yolks of the eggs boiled hard;
mixing the almonds, whilst pounding,
with a little of the soup, lest the latter
should grow oily. Pound them to a pulp,
and keep adding to them, by degrees, a
little soup, until they are thoroughly
mixed together. Let the soup be cool
when mixing, and do it perfectly smooth.
Strain it through a sieve, set it on the
fire, stir frequently, and serve hot. Just
before taking it up, add the cream. <i>Time.</i>—From
4 to 5 hours to simmer meat and
vegetables; 20 minutes to cook the vermicelli.
<i>Average cost</i> per quart, 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8
persons.</p>


<h3>ANCHOVY BUTTER.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of butter
allow 6 anchovies, 1 small bunch of
parsley. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash, bone, and pound
the anchovies well in a mortar; scald
the parsley, chop it, and rub through a
sieve; then pound all the ingredients
together, mix well, and make the butter
into pats immediately. This makes a
pretty dish, if fancifully moulded, for
breakfast or supper, and should be garnished
with parsley. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> to make 2 dishes, with 4 small
pats each. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>ANCHOVY SAUCE, for Fish.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 anchovies, 1 oz. of
butter, ½ pint of melted butter, cayenne
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Bone the anchovies,
and pound them in a mortar to a paste,
with 1 oz. of butter. Make the melted
butter hot, stir in the pounded anchovies
and cayenne; simmer for 3 or 4 minutes;
and, if liked, add a squeeze of lemon-juice.
A more general and expeditious
way of making this sauce is to stir in
1½ tablespoonfuls of anchovy essence to
½ pint of melted butter, and to add
seasoning to taste. Boil the whole up
for 1 minute, and serve hot. <i>Time.</i>—5
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> for ½ pint.
<i>Sufficient</i>, this quantity, for a brill, small
turbot, 2 soles, &amp;c.</p>


<h3>ANCHOVY TOAST.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Toast 2 or 3 slices of
bread, or, if wanted very savoury, fry
them in clarified butter, and spread on
them the paste made by recipe for <a href="#ANCHOVIES_Potted">potted
anchovies</a>. Made mustard, or a few
grains of cayenne, may be added to the
paste before laying it on the toast.</p>


<h3>ANCHOVIES, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 tablespoonful of oil,
½ a glass of white wine, sufficient flour to
thicken; 12 anchovies. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the
oil and wine together, with sufficient
flour to make them into a thickish paste;
cleanse the anchovies, wipe them, dip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
them in the paste, and fry of a nice brown
colour. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, for
this quantity, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 2 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>


<h3><a id="ANCHOVIES_Potted"></a>ANCHOVIES, Potted, or Anchovy
Butter.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 dozen anchovies, ½ lb.
of fresh butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the anchovies
thoroughly; bone and dry them,
and pound them in a mortar to a paste.
Mix the butter gradually with them, and
rub the whole through a sieve. Put it by
in small pots for use, and carefully exclude
the air with a bladder, as it soon
changes the colour of anchovies, besides
spoiling them. To potted anchovies may
be added pounded mace, cayenne, and
nutmeg to taste.</p>


<h3>APPLE CHARLOTTE, a very
simple.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—9 slices of bread and
butter, about 6 good-sized apples, 1
tablespoonful of minced lemon-peel, 2
tablespoonfuls of juice, moist sugar to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Butter a pie-dish; place
a layer of bread and butter, without the
crust, at the bottom; then a layer of
apples, pared, cored, and cut into thin
slices; sprinkle over these a portion of
the lemon-peel and juice, and sweeten
with moist sugar. Place another layer
of bread and butter, and then one of
apples, proceeding in this manner until
the dish is full; then cover it up with the
peel of the apples, to preserve the top
from browning or burning; bake in a
brisk oven for rather more than ¾ hour;
turn the charlotte on a dish, sprinkle
sifted sugar over, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour,
or a few minutes longer. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLE CHEESECAKES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of apple pulp, ¼ lb.
of sifted sugar, ¼ lb. of butter, 4 eggs,
the rind and juice of 1 lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare,
core, and boil sufficient apples to
make ½ lb. when cooked; add to these
the sugar, the butter, which should be
melted, the eggs, leaving out 2 of the
whites, and the grated rind and juice of
1 lemon; stir the mixture well; line some
patty-pans with puff-paste; put in the
mixture, and bake about 20 minutes.—<i>Time.</i>—About
20 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
for the above quantity, with the paste,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for about 18 or 20
cheesecakes. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to
March.</p>


<h3>APPLE CUSTARD, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 dozen large apples,
moist sugar to taste, 1 small teacupful
of cold water, the grated rind of 1 lemon,
1 pint of milk, 4 eggs, 2 oz. of loaf sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Peel, cut, and core the apples;
put them into a lined saucepan with the
cold water, and, as they heat, bruise
them to a pulp; sweeten with moist
sugar, and add the grated lemon-rind.
When cold, put the fruit at the bottom
of a pie-dish, and pour over it a custard,
made with the above proportion of milk,
eggs, and sugar; grate a little nutmeg
over the top, place the dish in a moderate
oven, and bake from 25 to 35 minutes.
The above proportions will make rather
a large dish. <i>Time.</i>—25 to 35 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, if fruit has to be
bought. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLE DUMPLINGS, Baked
(Plain family Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 apples, suet-crust, sugar
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare and take out
the cores of the apples with a scoop, and
make a suet-crust with ¾ lb. of flour to
6 oz. of suet; roll the apples in the crust,
previously sweetening them with moist
sugar, and taking care to join the paste
nicely. When they are formed into
round balls, put them on a tin, and bake
them for about ½ hour, or longer, should
the apples be very large; arrange them
pyramidically on a dish, and sift over
them some pounded white sugar. These
may be made richer by using puff-paste
instead of suet-crust. <i>Time.</i>—From ½ to
¾ hour, or longer. <i>Average cost</i>, 1½<i>d.</i> each.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to March, but flavourless after
the end of January.</p>


<h3>APPLE DUMPLINGS, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 apples, suet-crust, sugar
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare and take out
the cores of the apples with a scoop;
sweeten, and roll each apple in a piece
of crust, made with ¾ lb. of flour to
6 oz. of suet, and be particular that the
paste is nicely joined. Put the dumplings
into floured cloths, tie them securely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and place them in boiling water. Keep
them boiling from ¾ to 1 hour; remove
the cloths, and send them hot and quickly
to table. Dumplings boiled in knitted
cloths have a very pretty appearance
when they come to table. The cloths
should be made square, just large enough
to hold one dumpling, and should be
knitted in plain knitting, with <i>very coarse</i>
cotton. <i>Time.</i>—¾ to 1 hour, or longer
should the dumplings be very large.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1½<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to
March, but flavourless after the end of
January.</p>


<h3><a id="APPLE_FRITTERS"></a>APPLE FRITTERS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—For the batter, 2 tablespoonfuls
of flour, ½ oz. of butter,
½ saltspoonful of salt, 2 eggs, milk,
4 medium-sized apples, hot lard or clarified
beef-dripping. <i>Mode.</i>—Break the
eggs, dividing the whites from the yolks,
and beat them separately. Put the flour
into a basin, stir in the butter, which
should be melted to a cream; add the
salt, and moisten with sufficient warm
milk to make it of a proper consistency,
that is to say, a batter that will drop
from the spoon. Stir this well, rub down
any lumps that may be seen, add the
yolks and then the whites of the eggs,
which have been previously well whisked;
beat up the batter for a few minutes,
and it is ready for use. Now peel and
cut the apples into rather thick whole
slices, without dividing them, and stamp
out the middle of each slice, where the
core is, with a cutter. Throw the slices
into the batter; have ready a pan of
boiling lard or clarified dripping; take
out the pieces of apple one by one, put
them into the hot lard, and fry a nice
brown, turning them when required.
When done, lay them on a piece of
blotting-paper before the fire, to absorb
the greasy moisture; then dish on a
white d’oyley, piling the fritters one
above the other; strew over them some
pounded sugar, and serve very hot. The
flavour of the fritters would be very much
improved by soaking the pieces of apple
in a little wine, mixed with sugar and
lemon-juice, for 3 or 4 hours before wanted
for table; the batter, also, is better for
being mixed some hours before the
fritters are made. <i>Time.</i>—From 7 to 10
minutes to fry the fritters; 5 minutes to
drain them. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLE JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit
weighed after being pared, cored, and
sliced, allow ¾ lb. of preserving-sugar,
the grated rind of 1 lemon, the juice of ½
lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel the apples, core
and slice them very thin, and be particular
that they are all the same sort. Put
them into a jar, stand this in a saucepan
of boiling water, and let the apples
stew until quite tender. Previously to
putting the fruit into the jar, weigh
it, to ascertain the proportion of
sugar that may be required. Put
the apples into a preserving-pan, crush
the sugar to small lumps, and add it,
with the grated lemon-rind and juice, to
the apples. Simmer these over the fire
for ½ hour, reckoning from the time the
jam begins to simmer properly; remove
the scum as it rises, and, when the jam is
done, put it into pots for use. Place a
piece of oiled paper over the jam, and, to
exclude the air, cover the pots with tissue
paper dipped in the white of an egg, and
stretched over the top. This jam will
keep good for a long time. <i>Time.</i>—From
3 to 4 hours to stew in the jar; ½ hour
to boil after the jam begins to simmer.
<i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity, 5<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—7
or 8 lbs. of apples for 6 pots of
jam. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in September,
October, or November, when apples
can be bought at a reasonable price.</p>


<h3>APPLE JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To 6 lbs. of apples allow
3 pints of water; to every quart of juice
allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar;—the juice of
½ lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare, core, and cut
the apples into slices, and put them into
a jar, with water in the above proportion.
Place them in a cool oven, with the jar
well covered, and, when the juice is
thoroughly drawn and the apples are
quite soft, strain them through a jelly-bag.
To every quart of juice allow 2 lbs.
of loaf sugar, which should be crushed
to small lumps, and put into a preserving-pan
with the juice. Boil these together
for rather more than ½ hour, remove the
scum as it rises, add the lemon-juice just
before it is done, and put the jelly into
pots for use. This preparation is useful
for garnishing sweet dishes, and may be
turned out for dessert. <i>Time.</i>—The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
apples to be put in the oven over-night,
and left till morning; rather more than
½ hour to boil the jelly. <i>Average cost</i>, for
this quantity, 3<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 small
pots of jelly. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This should
be made in September, October, or
November.</p>


<h3>APPLE JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Apples, water; to every
pint of syrup allow ¾ lb. of loaf sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Pare and cut the apples into
pieces, remove the cores, and put them
in a preserving-pan with sufficient cold
water to cover them. Let them boil for
an hour; then drain the syrup from them
through a hair sieve or jelly-bag, and
measure the juice; to every pint allow
¾ lb. of loaf sugar, and boil these together
for ¾ hour, removing every particle of
scum as it rises, and keeping the jelly
well stirred, that it may not burn. A
little lemon-rind may be boiled with the
apples, and a small quantity of strained
lemon-juice may be put in the jelly just
before it is done, when the flavour is
liked. This jelly may be ornamented
with preserved greengages, or any other
preserved fruit, and will turn out very
prettily for dessert. It should be stored
away in small pots. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour to
boil the fruit and water; ¾ hour to boil
the juice with the sugar. <i>Average cost</i>,
for 6 lbs. of apples, with the other ingredients
in proportion, 3<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 small pots of jelly. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in September, October, or
November.</p>


<h3>APPLE JELLY, Clear, for immediate
Eating.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 dozen small apples,
1½ pint of spring-water; to every pint
of juice allow ½ lb. of loaf sugar, ½ oz. of
isinglass, the rind of ½ lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare,
core, and cut the apples into
quarters, and boil them, with the lemon-peel,
until tender; then strain off the
apples, and run the juice through a jelly-bag;
put the strained juice, with the
sugar and isinglass, which has been previously
boiled in ½ pint of water, into a
lined saucepan or preserving-pan; boil
all together for about ½ hour, and put the
jelly into moulds. When this jelly is
clear, and turned out well, it makes a
pretty addition to the supper-table, with
a little custard or whipped cream round
it: a little lemon-juice improves the
flavour, but it is apt to render the jelly
muddy and thick. If required to be kept
any length of time, rather a larger proportion
of sugar must be used. <i>Time.</i>—About
1 hour to boil the apples; ½ hour
the jelly. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
1½-pint mould. <i>Seasonable</i> from August
to March.</p>


<h3><a id="APPLE_JELLY_Thick_or_Marmalade"></a>APPLE JELLY, Thick, or Marmalade,
for Entremets or Dessert
Dishes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Apples; to every lb. of
pulp allow ¾ lb. of sugar, ½ teaspoonful
of minced lemon-peel. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel,
core, and boil the apples with only sufficient
water to prevent them from burning;
beat them to a pulp, and to every
lb. of pulp allow the above proportion of
sugar in lumps. Dip the lumps into
water; put these into a saucepan, and
boil till the syrup is thick and can be
well skimmed; then add this syrup to
the apple pulp, with the minced lemon-peel,
and stir it over a quick fire for
about 20 minutes, or till the apples cease
to stick to the bottom of the pan. The
jelly is then done, and may be poured
into moulds which have been previously
dipped in water, when it will turn out
nicely for dessert or a side dish; for
the latter, a little custard should be
poured round, and it should be garnished
with strips of citron or stuck with
blanched almonds. <i>Time.</i>—From ½ to ¾
hour to reduce the apples to a pulp; 20
minutes to boil after the sugar is added.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—1½ lb. of apple pulp sufficient
for a small mould. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to March; but is best and
cheapest in September, October, or
November.</p>

<h3>APPLE PUDDING, Rich Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. apple pulp, ½ lb. of
loaf sugar, 6 oz. of butter, the rind of 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
lemon, 6 eggs, puff-paste. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel,
core, and cut the apples, as for sauce;
put them into a stewpan, with only just
sufficient water to prevent them from
burning, and let them stew until reduced
to a pulp. Weigh the pulp, and to every
½ lb. add the sifted sugar, grated lemon-rind,
and 6 well-beaten eggs. Beat these
ingredients well together; then melt the
butter, stir it to the other things, put a
border of puff-paste round the dish, and
bake for rather more than ½ hour. The
butter should not be added until the
pudding is ready for the oven. <i>Time.</i>—½
to ¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLE PUDDING, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 large apples, 6 oz. of
moist sugar, ¼ lb. of butter, 4 eggs, 1 pint
of bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare, core,
and cut the apples, as for sauce, and boil
them until reduced to a pulp; then add
the butter, melted, and the eggs, which
should be well whisked. Beat up the
pudding for 2 or 3 minutes; butter a pie-dish;
put in a layer of bread-crumbs,
then the apple, and then another layer
of bread-crumbs; flake over these a few
tiny pieces of butter, and bake for about
½ hour. A very good economical pudding
may be made merely with apples, boiled
and sweetened, with the addition of a
few strips of lemon-peel. A layer of
bread-crumbs should be placed above and
below the apples, and the pudding baked
for ½ hour. <i>Time.</i>—About ½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to
March.</p>


<h3>APPLE PUDDING, Baked (Very
Good).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—5 moderate-sized apples,
2 tablespoonfuls of finely-chopped suet,
3 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 pint
of milk, a little grated nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix
the flour to a smooth batter with
the milk, add the eggs, which should be
well whisked, and put the latter into a
well-buttered pie-dish. Wipe the apples
clean, but do not pare them; cut them
in halves, and take out the cores; lay
them in the batter, rind uppermost;
shake the suet on the top, over which
also grate a little nutmeg; bake in a
moderate oven for an hour, and cover,
when served, with sifted loaf sugar.
This pudding is also very good with the
apples pared, sliced, and mixed with the
batter. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.</p>


<h3>APPLE PUDDING, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Suet crust, apples, sugar
to taste, 1 small teaspoonful of finely-minced
lemon-peel, 2 tablespoonfuls of
lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a butter or
suet crust by either of the given recipes,
using for a moderate-sized pudding from
¾ to 1 lb. of flour, with the other ingredients
in proportion. Butter a basin;
line it with some paste; pare, core, and
cut the apples into slices, and fill the
basin with these; add the sugar, the
lemon-peel and juice; and cover with
crust; pinch the edges together, flour
the cloth, place it over the pudding, tie
it securely, and put it into plenty of fast-boiling
water; let it boil from 2½ to 3
hours; then turn it out of the basin and
send to table quickly. Apple puddings
may also be boiled in a cloth without a
basin; but, when made in this way,
must be served without the least delay,
as the crust soon becomes heavy. Apple
pudding is a very convenient dish to
have when the dinner-hour is rather
uncertain, as it does not spoil by being
boiled an extra hour; care, however,
must be taken to keep it well covered
with water all the time, and not to allow
it to stop boiling. <i>Time.</i>—From 2½ to 3
hours, according to the quality of the
apples. <i>Average</i> cost, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>,
made with 1 lb. of flour, for 7 or 8
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to
March; but the apples become flavourless
and scarce after February.</p>


<h3>APPLE SAUCE, for Geese, Pork,
&amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 good-sized apples,
sifted sugar to taste, a piece of butter the
size of a walnut; water. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare,
core, and quarter the apples, and throw
them into cold water to preserve their
whiteness. Put them in a saucepan,
with sufficient water to moisten them,
and boil till soft enough to pulp. Beat
them up, adding sugar to taste, and a
small piece of butter. This quantity
is sufficient for a good-sized tureen.
<i>Time.</i>—According to the apples, about, ¾
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>, this
quantity, for a goose or couple of ducks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<h3>APPLE SNOW (a pretty Supper
Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—10 good-sized apples,
the whites of 10 eggs, the rind of 1
lemon, ½ lb. of pounded sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel,
core, and cut the apples into
quarters, and put them into a saucepan
with the lemon-peel, and sufficient water
to prevent them from burning,—rather
less than ½ pint. When they are tender,
take out the peel, beat them into a pulp,
let them cool, and stir them to the
whites of the eggs, which should be previously
beaten to a strong froth. Add
the sifted sugar, and continue the whisking
until the mixture becomes quite stiff,
and either heap it on a glass dish or
serve it in small glasses. The dish may
be garnished with preserved barberries or
strips of bright-coloured jelly, and a dish
of custards should be served with it, or
a jug of cream. <i>Time.</i>—From 30 to 40
minutes to stew the apples. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill a moderate-sized
glass dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from August
to March.</p>


<h3>APPLE SNOWBALLS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 teacupfuls of rice,
apples, moist sugar, cloves. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the rice and milk until three-parts
done; then strain it off, and pare and
core the apples without dividing them.
Put a small quantity of sugar and a clove
into each apple, put the rice round them,
and tie each ball separately in a cloth.
Boil until the apples are tender; then
take them up, remove the cloths, and
serve. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour to boil the rice
separately; ½ to 1 hour with the apple.
<i>Seasonable</i> from August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLE SOUFFLÉ.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of
milk, the rind of ½ lemon, sugar to taste,
the yolks of 4 eggs, the whites of 6, 1½ oz.
of butter, 4 tablespoonfuls of apple marmalade.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil the milk with the
lemon-peel until the former is well
flavoured; then strain it, put in the rice,
and let it gradually swell over a slow
fire, adding sufficient sugar to sweeten it
nicely. Then crush the rice to a smooth
pulp with the back of a wooden spoon;
line the bottom and sides of a round
cake-tin with it, and put it into the oven
to set; turn it out of the tin dexterously,
and be careful that the border of rice is
firm in every part. Mix with the marmalade
the beaten yolks of eggs and the
butter, and stir these over the fire until
the mixture thickens. Take it off the
fire; to this add the whites of the eggs,
which should be previously beaten to a
strong froth; stir all together, and put
it into the rice border. Bake in a
moderate oven for about ½ hour, or until
the soufflé rises very light. It should be
watched, and served instantly, or it will
immediately fall after it is taken from
the oven. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLE TART or PIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Puff-paste, apples; to
every lb. of unpared apples allow 2 oz. of
moist sugar, ½ teaspoonful of finely-minced
lemon-peel, 1 tablespoonful of
lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Make puff-paste by
either of the given recipes, with ½ lb. of
flour; place a border of it round the edge
of a pie-dish, and fill the dish with apples
pared, cored, and cut into slices; sweeten
with moist sugar, add the lemon-peel and
juice, and 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of water;
cover with crust, cut it evenly round
close to the edge of the pie-dish, and bake
in a hot oven from ½ to ¾ hour, or rather
longer, should the pie be very large.
When it is three-parts done, take it out
of the oven, put the white of an egg on
a plate, and, with the blade of a knife,
whisk it to a froth; brush the pie over
with this, then sprinkle upon it some
sifted sugar, and then a few drops of
water. Put the pie back into the oven,
and finish baking, and be particularly
careful that it does not catch or burn,
<i>which it is very liable to do after the
crust is iced</i>. If made with a plain crust,
the icing may be omitted. Many things
are suggested for the flavouring of apple
pie; some say 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of
beer, others the same quantity of sherry,
which very much improve the taste;
whilst the old-fashioned addition of a few
cloves is, by many persons, preferred to
anything else, as also a few slices of
quince. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour before the crust
is iced; 10 to 15 minutes afterwards.
<i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 2
lbs. of apples to a tart for 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from August to March; but
the apples become flavourless after
February.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<h3>APPLE TART (Creamed).</h3>

<p><i>Mode.</i>—Make an apple tart by the
preceding recipe, with the exception of
omitting the icing. When the tart is
baked, cut out the middle of the lid or
crust, leaving a border all round the dish.
Fill up with a nicely-made boiled custard,
grate a little nutmeg over the top,
and the pie is ready for table. This
tart is usually eaten cold; is rather an
old-fashioned dish, but, at the same
time, extremely nice. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLE TRIFLE (a Supper Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—10 good-sized apples, the
rind of ½ lemon, 6 oz. of pounded sugar,
½ pint of milk, ½ pint of cream, 2
eggs, whipped cream. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel,
core, and cut the apples into thin
slices, and put them into a saucepan
with 2 tablespoonfuls of water,
the sugar, and minced lemon-rind. Boil
all together until quite tender, and pulp
the apples through a sieve; if they
should not be quite sweet enough, add
a little more sugar, and put them at the
bottom of the dish to form a thick layer.
Stir together the milk, cream, and eggs,
with a little sugar, over the fire, and let
the mixture thicken, but do not allow it
to reach the boiling-point. When thick,
take it off the fire; let it cool a little,
then pour it over the apples. Whip
some cream with sugar, lemon-peel, &amp;c.,
the same as for other trifles; heap it
high over the custard, and the dish is
ready for table. It may be garnished as
fancy dictates, with strips of bright apple
jelly, slices of citron, &amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—From
30 to 40 minutes to stew the apples; 10
minutes to stir the custard over the fire.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i>, with cream at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per pint. <i>Sufficient</i> for a moderate-sized
trifle. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLES à la Portugaise.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 good boiling apples,
½ pint of water, 6 oz. of sugar, a layer
of apple marmalade, 8 preserved cherries,
garnishing of apricot jam. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel
the apples, and, with a scoop,
take out the cores; boil the fruit in
the above proportion of sugar and water,
without being too much done, and take
care the apples do not break. Have ready
some apple marmalade; cover the bottom
of a glass dish with this, level it, and lay
the apples in a sieve to drain; pile
them neatly on the marmalade, raising
them in the centre, and place a preserved
cherry in the middle of each. Garnish
with strips of candied citron or apricot
jam, and the dish is ready for table.
<i>Time.</i>—From 20 to 30 minutes to stew
the apples. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 1 entremets. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLES, Buttered (Sweet Entremets).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Apple marmalade or 7
good boiling apples, ½ pint of water,
6 oz. of sugar, 2 oz. of butter, a little
apricot jam. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare the apples,
and take out the cores with a scoop;
boil up the sugar and water for a few
minutes; then lay in the apples and simmer
them very gently until tender,
taking care not to let them break. Have
ready sufficient marmalade made by
the recipe for <span class="smcap"><a href="#APPLE_JELLY_Thick_or_Marmalade">Apple Marmalade</a></span>, flavoured
with lemon, to cover the bottom
of the dish; arrange the apples on this
with a piece of butter placed in each,
and in between them a few spoonfuls of
apricot jam or marmalade; put the dish
in the oven for 10 minutes, then sprinkle

<h3>APPLES AND RICE (a pretty
Dish of).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of
milk, the rind of ½ lemon, sugar to taste,
½ saltspoonful of salt, 8 apples, ¼ lb. of
sugar, ¼ pint of water, ½ pint of boiled
custard. <i>Mode.</i>—Flavour the milk with
lemon-rind, by boiling them together for
a few minutes; then take out the peel,
and put in the rice, with sufficient sugar
to sweeten it nicely, and boil gently
until the rice is quite soft; then let it
cool. In the meantime pare, quarter,
and core the apples, and boil them until
tender in a syrup made with sugar and
water in the above proportion; and, when
soft, lift them out on a sieve to drain.
Now put a middling-sized gallipot in the
centre of a dish; lay the rice all round
till the top of the gallipot is reached;
smooth the rice with the back of a spoon,
and stick the apples into it in rows, one
row sloping to the right, and the next to
the left. Set it in the oven to colour the
apples; then, when required for table,
remove the gallipot, garnish the rice with
preserved fruits, and pour in the middle

<div class="caption">COMPÔTE OF APPLES.</div>
</div>


<h3>APPLES, Flanc of; or Apples in a
raised Crust. (Sweet Entremets.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ lb. of short crust, 9
moderate-sized apples, the rind and juice
of ½ lemon, ½ lb. of white sugar, ¾ pint
of water, a few strips of candied citron.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make a plain stiff short crust, roll
it out to the thickness of ½ inch, and
butter an oval mould; line it with the
crust, and press it carefully all round
the sides, to obtain the form of the
mould, but be particular not to break
the paste. Pinch the part that just
rises above the mould with the paste-pincers,
and fill the case with flour;
bake it for about ¾ hour; then take it
out of the oven, remove the flour, put
the case back in the oven for another ¼
hour, and do not allow it to get scorched.
It is now ready for the apples, which
should be prepared in the following
manner: peel, and take out the cores with
a small knife, or a scoop for the purpose,
without dividing the apples; put them
into a small lined saucepan, just capable of
holding them, with sugar, water, lemon-juice
and rind, in the above proportion.
Simmer them very gently until tender;
then take out the apples, let them cool,
arrange them in the flanc or case, and boil
down the syrup until reduced to a thick
jelly; pour it over the apples, and garnish
with a few slices of candied citron.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A more simple flanc may be made
by rolling out the paste, cutting the
bottom of a round or oval shape, and
then a narrow strip for the sides: these
should be stuck on with the white of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
egg to the bottom piece, and the flanc
then filled with raw fruit, with sufficient
sugar to sweeten it nicely. It will not
require so long baking as in a mould; but
the crust must be made everywhere of an
equal thickness, and so perfectly joined
that the juice does not escape. This dish
may also be served hot, and should be
garnished in the same manner, or a little
melted apricot jam may be poured over
the apples, which very much improves
their flavour. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 1 hour
to bake the flanc; from 30 to 40 minutes
to stew the apples very gently. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 entremets or
side-dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to
March.</p>


<h3>APPLES, Ginger (a pretty Supper
or Dessert Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ oz. of whole ginger,
¼ pint of whiskey, 3 lbs. of apples, 2 lbs.
of white sugar, the juice of 2 lemons.
<i>Mode.</i>—Bruise the ginger, put it into a
small jar, pour over sufficient whiskey
to cover it, and let it remain for 3 days;
then cut the apples into thin slices, after
paring and coring them; add the sugar
and the lemon-juice, which should be
strained; and simmer all together <i>very
gently</i> until the apples are transparent,
but not broken. Serve cold, and garnish
the dish with slices of candied lemon-peel
or preserved ginger. <i>Time.</i>—3 days
to soak the ginger; about ¾ hour to
simmer the apples very gently. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 dishes. <i>Seasonable</i>
from August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLES Iced, or Apple Hedgehog.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—About 3 dozen good
boiling apples, 1 lb. of sugar, ½ pint of
water, the rind of ½ lemon minced very
fine, the whites of 2 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls
of pounded sugar, a few sweet almonds.
<i>Mode.</i>—Peel and core a dozen of
the apples without dividing them, and stew
them very gently in a lined saucepan
with ½ lb. of the sugar and ½ pint of
water, and when tender lift them carefully
on to a dish. Have ready the remainder
of the apples, pared, cored, and
cut into thin slices; put them into the
same syrup with the other ½ lb. of sugar,
the lemon-peel, and boil gently until
they are reduced to a marmalade; keeping
them stirred, to prevent them from
burning. Cover the bottom of the dish
with some of the marmalade, and over
that a layer of the stewed apples, in the
insides of which, and between each, place
some of the marmalade; then place
another layer of apples, and fill up the
cavities with marmalade as before, forming
the whole into a raised oval shape.
Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff
froth, mix with them the pounded sugar,
and cover the apples very smoothly all
over with the icing; blanch and cut each
almond into 4 or 5 strips; place these strips
at equal distances over the icing, sticking
up; strew over a little rough pounded
sugar, and put the dish in a very slow
oven, to colour the almonds, and so allow
the apples to get warm through. This
entremets may also be served cold, and
makes a pretty supper-dish. <i>Time.</i>—From
20 to 30 minutes to stew the apples.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from August
to March.</p>


<h3>APPLES in Red Jelly (a pretty
Supper Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 good-sized apples, 12
cloves, 6 oz. of pounded sugar, 1 lemon,
2 teacupfuls of water, 1 tablespoonful of
gelatine, a few drops of prepared cochineal.
<i>Mode.</i>—Choose rather large
apples; peel them and take out the
cores, either with a scoop or a small
silver knife, and put into each apple
2 cloves and as much sifted sugar as
they will hold. Place them, without
touching each other, in a large pie-dish;
add more white sugar, the juice of 1
lemon, and 2 teacupfuls of water. Bake
in the oven, with a dish over them, until
they are done. Look at them frequently,
and, as each apple is cooked, place it in
a glass dish. They must not be left in
the oven after they are done, or they will
break, and so would spoil the appearance
of the dish. When the apples are neatly
arranged in the dish without touching
each other, strain the liquor in which
they have been stewing into a lined
saucepan; add to it the rind of the
lemon, and a tablespoonful of gelatine
which has been previously dissolved in
cold water, and, if not sweet, a little
more sugar, and 6 cloves. Boil till quite
clear; colour with a few drops of prepared
cochineal, and strain the jelly
through a double muslin into a jug; let
it cool a <i>little</i>; then pour it into the
dish round the apples. When quite cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
garnish the tops of the apples with a
bright-coloured marmalade, jelly, or the
white of an egg beaten to a strong froth,
with a little sifted sugar. <i>Time.</i>—From
30 to 50 minutes to bake the apples.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i>, with the garnishing.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from August to March.</p>


<h3>APPLES, to preserve, in Quarters
(in imitation of Ginger).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of apples
allow ¾ lb. of sugar, 1½ oz. of the best
white ginger; 1 oz. of ginger to every
½ pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel, core, and
quarter the apples, and put the fruit,
sugar, and ginger in layers into a wide-mouthed
jar, and let them remain for 2
days; then infuse 1 oz. of ginger in ½
pint of boiling water, and cover it closely,
and let it remain for 1 day: this quantity
of ginger and water is for 3 lbs. of apples,
with the other ingredients in proportion.
Put the apples, &amp;c., into a preserving-pan
with the water strained from the
ginger, and boil till the apples look clear
and the syrup is rich, which will be in
about an hour. The rind of a lemon
may be added just before the apples have
finished boiling; and great care must be
taken not to break the pieces of apple
in putting them into the jars. Serve
on glass dishes for dessert. <i>Time.</i>—2
days for the apples to remain in the jar
with sugar, &amp;c.; 1 day to infuse the
ginger; about 1 hour to boil the apples.
<i>Average cost</i>, for 3 lbs. of apples, with
the other ingredients in proportion,
2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—3 lbs. should fill 3
moderate-sized jars. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This
should be made in September, October,
or November.</p>


<h3>APPLES, Stewed, and Custard
(a pretty Dish for a Juvenile
Supper).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—7 good-sized apples, the
rind of ½ lemon or 4 cloves, ½ lb. of sugar,
¾ pint of water, ½ pint of custard. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare
and take out the cores of the
apples, without dividing them, and, if
possible, leave the stalks on; boil the
sugar and water together for 10 minutes;
then put in the apples with the lemon-rind
or cloves, whichever flavour may
be preferred, and simmer gently until
they are tender, taking care not to let
them break. Dish them neatly on a glass
dish, reduce the syrup by boiling it
quickly for a few minutes, let it cool a
little; then pour it over the apples.
Have ready quite ½ pint of custard made
by the recipe for <a href="#CUSTARDS_Boiled">Boiled Custard</a>; pour
it round, but not over, the apples when
they are quite cold, and the dish is ready
for table. A few almonds blanched and
cut into strips, and stuck in the apples,
would improve their appearance. <i>Time.</i>—From
20 to 30 minutes to stew the
apples. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to
fill a large glass dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to March.</p>


<h3>APRICOT CREAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 to 16 ripe apricots, ½
lb. of sugar, 1½ pint of milk, the yolks of
8 eggs, 1 oz. of isinglass. <i>Mode.</i>—Divide
the apricots, take out the stones, and
boil them in a syrup made with ¼ lb. of
sugar and ¼ pint of water, until they form
a thin marmalade, which rub through a
sieve. Boil the milk with the other ¼ lb.
of sugar, let it cool a little, then mix
with it the yolks of eggs which have been
previously well beaten; put this mixture
into a jug, place this jug in boiling water,
and stir it one way over the fire until it
thickens; but on no account let it boil.
Strain through a sieve, add the isinglass,
previously boiled with a small quantity
of water, and keep stirring it till nearly
cold; then mix the cream with the
apricots; stir well, put it into an oiled
mould, and, if convenient, set it on ice;
at any rate, in a very cool place. It
should turn out on the dish without any
difficulty. In winter-time, when fresh
apricots are not obtainable, a little jam
may be substituted for them. <i>Time.</i>—From
20 to 30 minutes to boil the
apricots. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
to fill a quart mould. <i>Seasonable</i> in
August, September, and October.</p>


<h3>APRICOT JAM, or Marmalade.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of ripe
apricots, weighed after being skinned
and stoned, allow 1 lb. of sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare
the apricots, which should be ripe,
as thinly as possible, break them in half,
and remove the stones. Weigh the fruit,
and to every lb. allow the same proportion
of loaf sugar. Pound the sugar very
finely in a mortar, strew it over the
apricots, which should be placed on
dishes, and let them remain for 12 hours.
Break the stones, blanch the kernels, and
put them with the sugar and fruit into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
preserving-pan. Let these simmer very
gently until clear; take out the pieces of
apricot singly as they become so, and, as
fast as the scum rises, carefully remove
it. Put the apricots into small jars, pour
over them the syrup and kernels, cover
the jam with pieces of paper dipped in
the purest salad-oil, and stretch over the
top of the jars tissue paper, cut about 2
inches larger and brushed over with the
white of an egg: when dry, it will be
perfectly hard and air-tight. <i>Time.</i>—12
hours, sprinkled with sugar; about ¾ hour
to boil the jam. <i>Average cost.</i>—When
cheap, apricots may be purchased for
preserving at about 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per gallon.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—10 lbs. of fruit for 12 pots of
jam. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in August
or September.</p>


<h3>APRICOT PUDDING, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 large apricots, ¾ pint
of bread-crumbs, 1 pint of milk, 3 oz. of
pounded sugar, the yolks of 4 eggs, 1
glass of sherry. <i>Mode.</i>—Make the milk
boiling hot, and pour it on to the bread-crumbs;
when half cold, add the sugar,
the well-whisked yolks of the eggs, and
the sherry. Divide the apricots in half,
scald them until they are soft, and break
them up with a spoon, adding a few of
the kernels, which should be well pounded
in a mortar; then mix the fruit and other
ingredients together, put a border of
paste round the dish, fill with the mixture,
and bake the pudding from ½ to ¾
hour. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, in full season, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in August,
September, and October.</p>


<h3>APRICOT TART.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 or 14 apricots, sugar
to taste, puff-paste or short crust.
<i>Mode.</i>—Break the apricots in half, take
out the stones, and put them into a pie-dish,
in the centre of which place a very
small cup or jar, bottom uppermost;
sweeten with good moist sugar, but add
no water. Line the edge of the dish with
paste, put on the cover, and ornament
the pie in any of the usual modes. Bake
from ½ to ¾ hour, according to size; and
if puff-paste is used, glaze it about 10
minutes before the pie is done, and put
it into the oven again to set the glaze.
Short crust merely requires a little sifted
sugar sprinkled over it before being sent
to table. Green apricots make very good
tarts, but they should be boiled with a
little sugar and water before they are
covered with the crust. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, in full season, 1<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
in August, September, and October;
green ones rather earlier.</p>


<h3>APRICOTS, Compôte of (an elegant
Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of syrup (<i>see</i>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#SYRUP">Syrup</a></span>), 12 green apricots. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
the syrup by the given recipe, and,
when it is ready, put in the apricots
whilst the syrup is boiling. Simmer
them very gently until tender, taking
care not to let them break; take them
out carefully, arrange them on a glass
dish, let the syrup cool a little, pour it
over the apricots, and, when cold, serve.
<i>Time.</i>—From 15 to 20 minutes to simmer
the apricots. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in
June and July, with green apricots.</p>


<h3>APRICOTS, Flanc of, or Compôte
of Apricots in a Raised Crust
(Sweet Entremets).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ lb. of short crust (<i>see</i>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#CRUST_Very_good_Short_for_Fruit_Tarts">Crust</a></span>), from 9 to 12 good-sized apricots,
¾ pint of water, ½ lb. of sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
a short crust by the given recipe,
and line a mould with it. Boil the sugar
and water together for 10 minutes;
halve the apricots, take out the stones,
and simmer them in the syrup until tender;
watch them carefully, and take them
up, for fear they should break. Arrange
them neatly in the flanc or case; boil the
syrup until reduced to a jelly; pour it
over the fruit, and serve either hot or
cold. Greengages, plums of all kinds,
peaches, &amp;c., may be done in the same
manner, as also currants, raspberries,
gooseberries, strawberries, &amp;c.; but with
the last-named fruits, a little currant-juice
added to them will be found an
improvement. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 1 hour
to bake the flanc, from 15 to 20 minutes
to simmer the apricots. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 entremets or
side-dish. <i>Seasonable</i> in July, August,
and September.</p>

<p>The pretty appearance of this dish depends
on the fruit being whole; as each
apricot is done, it should be taken out of
the syrup immediately.</p>

<h3>ARROWROOT  BISCUITS, or
Drops.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of butter, 6 eggs, ½
lb. of flour, 6 oz. of arrowroot, ½ lb. of
pounded loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat the
butter to a cream; whisk the eggs to a
strong froth, add them to the butter, stir
in the flour a little at a time, and beat
the mixture well. Break down all the
lumps from the arrowroot, and add that
with the sugar to the other ingredients.
Mix all well together, drop the dough on
a buttered tin, in pieces the size of a
shilling, and bake the biscuits about ¼
hour in a slow oven. If the whites of
the eggs are separated from the yolks,
and both are beaten separately before
being added to the other ingredients, the
biscuits will be much lighter. <i>Time.</i>—¼
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
to make from 3 to 4 dozen biscuits. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<h3>ARROWROOT BLANCMANGE
(an inexpensive Supper Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 heaped tablespoonfuls
of arrowroot, 1½ pint of milk, 3 laurel-leaves
or the rind of ½ lemon, sugar to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix to a smooth batter
the arrowroot with ½ pint of the milk;
put the other pint on the fire, with
laurel-leaves or lemon-peel, whichever
may be preferred, and let the milk steep
until it is well flavoured; then strain
the milk, and add it, boiling, to the
mixed arrowroot; sweeten it with sifted
sugar, and let it boil, stirring it all the
time, till it thickens sufficiently to come
from the saucepan. Grease a mould with
pure salad-oil, pour in the blancmange,
and, when quite set, turn it out on a dish,
and pour round it a compôte of any kind
of fruit, or garnish it with jam. A
tablespoonful of brandy, stirred in just
before the blancmange is moulded, very
much improves the flavour of this sweet
dish. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> without the garnishing.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>ARROWROOT PUDDING, Baked
or Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 tablespoonfuls of arrowroot,
1½ pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter, the
rind of ½ lemon, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls
of moist sugar, a little grated nutmeg.
<i>Mode.</i>—Mix the arrowroot with as much
cold milk as will make it into a smooth
batter, moderately thick; put the remainder
of the milk into a stewpan with
the lemon-peel, and let it infuse for about
½ hour; when it boils, strain it gently to
the batter, stirring it all the time to keep
it smooth; then add the butter; beat
this well in until thoroughly mixed, and
sweeten with moist sugar. Put the mixture
into a pie-dish, round which has
been placed a border of paste; grate a
little nutmeg over the top, and bake
the pudding from 1 to 1¼ hour, in a
moderate oven, or boil it the same length
of time in a well-buttered basin. To
enrich this pudding, stir to the other
ingredients, just before it is put in the
oven, 3 well-whisked eggs, and add a
tablespoonful of brandy. For a nursery
pudding, the addition of the latter ingredients
will be found quite superfluous, as
also the paste round the edge of the dish.
<i>Time.</i>—1 to 1¼ hour, baked or boiled.
<i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>ARROWROOT SAUCE, for Puddings.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 small teaspoonfuls of
arrowroot, 4 dessertspoonfuls of pounded
sugar, the juice of 1 lemon, ¼ teaspoonful
of grated nutmeg, ½ pint of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Mix the arrowroot smoothly with
the water; put this into a stewpan; add
the sugar, strained lemon-juice, and
grated nutmeg. Stir these ingredients
over the fire until they boil, when the
sauce is ready for use. A small quantity
of wine, or any liqueur, would very much
improve the flavour of this sauce: it is
usually served with bread, rice, custard,
or any dry pudding that is not very rich.
<i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 15 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7 persons.</p>


<h3>ARROWROOT, to make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Two teaspoonfuls of arrowroot,
3 tablespoonfuls of cold water,
½ pint of boiling water. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix
the arrowroot smoothly in a basin with
the cold water, then pour on it the <i>boiling</i>
water, <i>stirring</i> all the time. The
water must be <i>boiling</i> at the time it is
poured on the mixture, or it will not
thicken; if mixed with hot water only, it
must be put into a clean saucepan, and
boiled until it thickens; but this occasions
more trouble, and is quite unnecessary,
if the water is boiling at first. Put
the arrowroot into a tumbler, sweeten it
with lump sugar, and flavour it with
grated nutmeg or cinnamon, or a piece
of lemon-peel, or, when allowed, 3 tablespoonfuls
of port or sherry. As arrowroot
is in itself flavourless and insipid, it is
almost necessary to add the wine to
make it palatable. Arrowroot made
with milk instead of water is far nicer,
but is not so easily digested. It should
be mixed in the same manner, with 3
tablespoonfuls of cold water, the boiling
milk then poured on it, and well stirred.
When made in this manner, no wine
should be added, but merely sugar, and
a little grated nutmeg or lemon-peel.
<i>Time.</i>—If obliged to be boiled, 2 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>d.</i> per pint. <i>Sufficient</i> to
make ½ pint of arrowroot.</p>


<h3>ARTICHOKES, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each ½ gallon of water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, a
piece of soda the size of a shilling; artichokes.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the artichokes
well in several waters; see that no insects
remain about them, and trim away
the leaves at the bottom. Cut off the
stems and put them into <i>boiling</i> water,
to which has been added salt and soda
in the above proportion. Keep the
saucepan uncovered, and let them boil
quickly until tender; ascertain when
they are done by thrusting a fork in
them, or by trying if the leaves can
be easily removed. Take them out, let
them drain for a minute or two, and
serve in a napkin, or with a little white
sauce poured over. A tureen of melted
butter should accompany them. This
vegetable, unlike any other, is considered
better for being gathered two
or three days; but they must be well
soaked and washed previous to dressing.
<i>Time.</i>—20 to 25 minutes, after the
water boils. <i>Sufficient</i>,—a dish of 5 or
6 for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from July to
the beginning of September.</p>

of the leaves, as also the stems; put
the artichokes into boiling water, with
the above proportion of salt, pepper,
herbs, and butter; let them boil quickly
until tender, keeping the lid of the
saucepan off, and when the leaves come
out easily, they are cooked enough.
To keep them a beautiful green, put a
large piece of cinder into a muslin bag,

plain melted butter. <i>Time.</i>—20 to 25
minutes. <i>Sufficient</i>,—5 or 6 sufficient for

keep stirring over the fire until the
artichokes are quite hot, and serve.
A pretty way of serving Jerusalem artichokes

<div class="caption">BOILED ASPARAGUS.</div>
</div>

<h3>ASPARAGUS, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each ½ gallon of water
allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt;
asparagus. <i>Mode.</i>—Asparagus should be
dressed as soon as possible after it is cut,
although it may be kept for a day or two
by putting the stalks into cold water;
yet to be good, like every other vegetable,
it cannot be cooked too fresh. Scrape
the white part of the stems, <i>beginning</i>
from the <i>head</i>, and throw them into cold
water; then tie them into bundles of
about 20 each, keeping the heads all one
way, and cut the stalks evenly, that they
may all be the same length; put them
into <i>boiling</i> water, with salt in the above
proportion; keep them boiling quickly until
tender, with the saucepan uncovered.
When the asparagus is done, dish it upon
toast, which should be dipped in the
water it was cooked in, and leave the
white ends outward each way, with the
points meeting in the middle. Serve
with a tureen of melted butter. <i>Time.</i>—15
to 18 minutes after the water boils.
<i>Average cost</i>, in full season, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the
100 heads. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow about 50
heads for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—May
be had forced from January, but
cheapest in May, June and July.</p>

<h3>ASPARAGUS-PEAS (Entremets,
or to be served as a Side Dish,
with the Second Course).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—100 heads of asparagus,
2 oz. of butter, a small bunch of parsley,
2 or 3 green onions, flour, 1 lump
of sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls
of cream, salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Carefully
scrape the asparagus, cut it into
pieces of an equal size, avoiding that
which is in the least hard or tough,
and throw them into cold water. Then
boil the asparagus in salt and water until
three-parts done; take it out, drain, and
place it on a cloth to dry the moisture
away from it. Put it into a stewpan
with the butter, parsley, and onions, and
shake over a brisk fire for 10 minutes.
Dredge in a little flour, add the sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and moisten with boiling water. When
boiled a short time and reduced, take
out the parsley and onions, thicken with
the yolks of 2 eggs beaten with the
cream; add a seasoning of salt, and
when the whole is on the point of simmering,
serve. Make the sauce sufficiently
thick to adhere to the vegetable.
<i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a pint. <i>Seasonable</i> in May, June,
and July.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS PUDDING (a delicious
Dish, to be served with the
Second Course).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of asparagus peas,
4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 tablespoonful
of <i>very finely</i> minced ham, 1 oz.
of butter, pepper and salt to taste, milk.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the nice green tender
parts of asparagus, about the size of
peas; put them into a basin with the
eggs, which should be well beaten, and
the flour, ham, butter, pepper, and salt.
Mix all these ingredients well together,
and moisten with sufficient milk to make
the pudding of the consistency of thick
batter; put it into a pint buttered mould,
tie it down tightly with a floured cloth,
place it in <i>boiling water</i>, and let it boil
for 2 hours; turn it out of the mould on
to a hot dish, and pour plain melted butter
<i>round</i>, but not over, the pudding.
Green peas pudding may be made in
exactly the same manner, substituting
peas for the asparagus. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per pint. <i>Seasonable</i>
in May, June, and July.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—100 heads of asparagus,
2 quarts of medium stock (see <span class="smcap"><a href="#STOCKS">Stock</a></span>), 1
pint of water, salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Scrape the
asparagus, but do not cut off any of the
stems, and boil it in a pint of water
salted, <i>until the heads are nearly done</i>.
Then drain the asparagus, cut off the
green heads very neatly, and put them
on one side until the soup is ready. If
the stock is not made, add the stems of
asparagus to the rest of the vegetables;
if, however, the stock is ready, boil the
stems a little longer in the same water
that they were first cooked in. Then
strain them off, add the asparagus water
to the stock, and when all is boiling drop
in the green heads (or peas as they are
called), and simmer for 2 or 3 minutes.
If the soup boils long after the asparagus
is put in, the appearance of the vegetable
would be quite spoiled. A small quantity
of sherry, added after the soup is put
into the tureen, would improve this soup
very much. Sometimes a French roll
is cut up and served in it. <i>Time.</i>—<i>To
nearly cook</i> the asparagus, 12 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from May
to August.</p>


<h3>ASPIC, or Ornamental Savoury
Jelly.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 lbs. of knuckle of veal,
1 cow-heel, 3 or 4 slices of ham, any
poultry trimmings, 2 carrots, 1 onion,
1 faggot of savoury herbs, 1 glass of
sherry, 3 quarts of water; seasoning
to taste of salt and whole white pepper;
3 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Lay the ham on
the bottom of a stewpan, cut up the
veal and cow-heel into small pieces,
and lay them on the ham; add the
poultry trimmings, vegetables, herbs,
sherry, and water, and let the whole
simmer very gently for 4 hours, carefully
taking away all scum that may rise to
the surface; strain through a fine sieve,
and pour into an earthen pan to get cold.
Have ready a clean stewpan, put in the
jelly, and be particular to leave the sediment
behind, or it will not be clear.
Add the whites of 3 eggs, with salt and
pepper, to clarify; keep stirring over
the fire till the whole becomes very
white; then draw it to the side, and let
it stand till clear. When this is the case,
strain it through a cloth or jelly-bag, and
use it for moulding poultry, &amp;c. Tarragon
vinegar may be added to give an
additional flavour. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether 4½
hours. <i>Average cost</i> for this quantity, 4<i>s.</i></p>

<h3>BACON, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Bacon; water. <i>Mode.</i>—As
bacon is frequently excessively salt,
let it be soaked in warm water for an
hour or two previous to dressing it; then
pare off the rusty parts, and scrape the
under-side
and rind as
clean as
possible.
Put it into
a saucepan
of cold water;
let it
come gradually to a boil, and as fast as
the scum rises to the surface of the water,
remove it. Let it simmer very gently
until it is <i>thoroughly</i> done; then take it
up, strip off the skin, and sprinkle over
the bacon a few bread raspings, and
garnish with tufts of cauliflower or
Brussels sprouts. When served alone,
young and tender broad beans or green
peas are the usual accompaniments.
<i>Time.</i>—1 lb. of bacon, ¾ hour; 2 lbs.,
1½ hour. <i>Average cost,</i> 10<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per lb.
for the primest parts. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2 lbs.,
when served with poultry or veal, sufficient
for 10 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>

<h3>BACON, Broiled Rashers of.</h3>

<p>Before purchasing bacon, ascertain that
it is perfectly free from rust, which may
easily be detected by its yellow colour;
and for broiling, the streaked part of the
thick flank is generally the most esteemed.
Cut it into <i>thin</i> slices, take off
the rind, and broil over a nice clear fire;
turn it two or three times, and serve very
hot. Should there be any cold bacon
left from the previous day, it answers
very well for breakfast, cut into slices,
and broiled or fried. <i>Time.</i>—3 or 4
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per
lb. for the primest parts. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When the bacon is cut very
thin, the slices may be curled round and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
fastened by means of small skewers, and
fried or toasted before the fire.</p>


<h3>BACON and HAMS, Curing of.</h3>

<p>The carcass of the hog, after hanging
over-night to cool, is laid on a strong
bench or stool, and the head is separated
from the body at the neck close behind
the ears; the feet and also the internal
fat are removed. The carcass is next
divided into two sides in the following
manner:—The ribs are divided about an
inch from the spine on each side, and
the spine, with the ends of the ribs
attached, together with the internal
flesh between it and the kidneys, and
also the flesh above it, throughout the
whole length of the sides, are removed.
The portion of the carcass thus cut out
is in the form of a wedge—the breadth
of the interior consisting of the breadth
of the spine, and about an inch of the
ribs on each side, being diminished to
about half an inch at the exterior or skin
along the back. The breastbone, and
also the first anterior rib, are also dissected
from the side. Sometimes the
whole of the ribs are removed; but this,
for reasons afterwards to be noticed, is
a very bad practice. When the hams
are cured separately from the sides,
which is generally the case, they are cut
out so as to include the hock-bone, in a
similar manner to the London mode of
cutting a haunch of mutton. The carcass
of the hog thus cut up is ready for being
salted, which process, in large curing establishments,
is generally as follows:—The
skin side of the pork is rubbed over
with a mixture of fifty parts by weight
of salt, and one part of saltpetre in
powder, and the incised parts of the ham
or flitch, and the inside of the flitch,
covered with the same. The salted bacon,
in pairs of flitches with the insides to
each other, is piled one pair of flitches
above another on benches slightly inclined,
and furnished with spouts or
troughs to convey the brine to receivers
in the floor of the salting-house, to be
afterwards used for pickling pork for
navy purposes. In this state the bacon
remains a fortnight, which is sufficient
for flitches cut from hogs of a carcass
weight less than 15 stone (14 lbs. to the
stone). Flitches of a larger size, at the
expiration of that time, are wiped dry
and reversed in their place in the pile,
having, at the same time, about half the
first quantity of fresh, dry, common salt
sprinkled over the inside and incised
parts; after which they remain on the
benches for another week. Hams being
thicker than flitches, will require, when
less than 20 lbs. weight, 3 weeks; and
when above that weight, 4 weeks to remain
under the above described process.
The next and last process in the preparation
of bacon and hams, previous to
being sent to market, is drying. This is
effected by hanging the flitches and hams
for 2 or 3 weeks in a room heated by
stoves, or in a smoke-house, in which
they are exposed for the same length of
time to the smoke arising from the slow
combustion of the sawdust of oak or other
hard wood. The latter mode of completing
the curing process has some
advantages over the other, as by it the
meat is subject to the action of <i>creosote</i>,
a volatile oil produced by the combustion
of the sawdust, which is powerfully antiseptic.
The process also furnishing a
thin covering of a resinous varnish, excludes
the air not only from the muscle,
but also from the fat—thus effectually
preventing the meat from becoming
rusted; and the principal reasons for
condemning the practice of removing the
ribs from the flitches of pork are, that
by so doing the meat becomes unpleasantly
hard and pungent in the process
of salting, and, by being more exposed
to the action of the air, becomes
sooner and more extensively rusted.
Notwithstanding its superior efficacy in
completing the process of curing, the
flavour which smoke-drying imparts to
meat is disliked by many persons, and it
is therefore by no means the most general
mode of drying adopted by mercantile
curers. A very impure variety of <i>pyroligneous</i>
acid, or vinegar made from the
destructive distillation of wood, is sometimes
used, on account of the highly
preservative power of the creosote which
it contains, and also to impart the smoke-flavour;
in which latter object, however,
the coarse flavour of tar is given, rather
than that derived from the smoke from
combustion of wood. A considerable
portion of the bacon and hams salted
in Ireland is exported from that country
packed amongst salt, in bales, immediately
from the salting process, without
having been in any degree dried. In the
process of salting above described, pork
loses from 8 to 10 per cent of its weight,
according to the size and quality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
meat; and a further diminution of
weight, to the extent of 5 to 6 per cent.
takes place in drying during the first
fortnight after being taken out of salt;
so that the total loss in weight occasioned
by the preparation of bacon and hams in
a proper state for market, is not less on
an average than 15 per cent. on the weight
of the fresh pork.</p>


<h3>BACON, to Cure and Keep it free
from Rust (Cobbett’s Recipe).</h3>

<p>The two sides that remain, and which
are called flitches, are to be cured for
bacon. They are first rubbed with salt
on their insides, or flesh sides, then placed
one on the other, the flesh sides uppermost,
in a salting-trough which has a
gutter round its edges to drain away the
brine; for, to have sweet and fine bacon,
the flitches must not be sopping in brine,
which gives it the sort of vile taste that
barrel and sea pork have. Every one
knows how different is the taste of fresh
dry salt from that of salt in a dissolved
state; therefore change the salt often,—once
in 4 or 5 days; let it melt and sink
in, but not lie too long; twice change
the flitches, put that at bottom which was
first on the top: this mode will cost you
a great deal more in salt than the sopping
mode, but without it your bacon will not
be so sweet and fine, nor keep so well.
As for the time required in making your
flitches sufficiently salt, it depends on
circumstances. It takes a longer time
for a thick than a thin flitch, and longer
in dry than in damp weather, or in a dry
than in a damp place; but for the flitches
of a hog of five score, in weather not very
dry or damp, about 6 weeks may do; and
as yours is to be fat, which receives
little injury from over-salting, give time
enough, for you are to have bacon until
Christmas comes again. The place for
salting should, like a dairy, always be
cool, but well ventilated; confined air,
though cool, will taint meat sooner than
the midday sun accompanied by a breeze.
With regard to smoking the bacon, two
precautions are necessary: first, to hang
the flitches where no rain comes down
upon them; and next, that the smoke
must proceed from wood, not peat, turf,
or coal. As to the time required to smoke
a flitch, it depends a good deal upon
whether there be a constant fire beneath;
and whether the fire be large or small:
a month will do, if the fire be pretty
constant and rich, as a farm-house fire
usually is; but over-smoking, or rather
too long hanging in the air, makes the
bacon rust; great attention should therefore
be paid to this matter. The flitch
ought not to be dried up to the hardness
of a board, and yet it ought to be perfectly
dry. Before you hang it up, lay it
on the floor, scatter the flesh side pretty
thickly over with bran, or with some
fine sawdust, not of deal or fir; rub it on
the flesh, or pat it well down upon it:
this keeps the smoke from getting into
the little openings, and makes a sort of
crust to be dried on. To keep the bacon
sweet and good, and free from hoppers,
sift fine some clean and dry wood ashes.
Put some at the bottom of a box or chest
long enough to hold a flitch of bacon; lay
in one flitch, then put in more ashes, then
another flitch, and cover this with six or
eight inches of the ashes. The place where
the box or chest is kept ought to be dry,
and, should the ashes become damp, they
should be put in the fireplace to dry, and
when cold, put back again. With these
precautions, the bacon will be as good at
the end of the year as on the first day. For
simple general rules, these may be safely
taken as a guide; and those who implicitly
follow the directions given, will
possess at the expiration of from 6 weeks
to 2 months well-flavoured and well-cured
bacon.</p>


<h3>BACON or HAMS, to Cure in the
Devonshire way.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every 14 lbs. of meat
allow 2 oz. of saltpetre, 2 oz. of salt prunella,
1 lb. of common salt. For the
pickle, 3 gallons of water, 5 lbs. of common
salt, 7 lbs. of coarse sugar, 3 lbs. of bay
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Weigh the sides, hams,
and cheeks, and to every 14 lbs. allow the
above proportion of saltpetre, salt prunella,
and common salt. Pound and mix
these together, and rub well into the
meat; lay it in a stone trough or tub,
rubbing it thoroughly, and turning it
daily for two successive days. At the
end of the second day, pour on it a pickle
made as follows:—Put the above ingredients
into a saucepan, set it on the fire,
and stir frequently; remove all the scum,
allow it to boil for ¼ hour, and pour it
hot over the meat. Let the hams, &amp;c.,
be well rubbed and turned daily; if the
meat is small, a fortnight will be sufficient
for the sides and shoulders to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in the pickle, and the hams 3 weeks;
if from 30 lbs. and upwards, 3 weeks will
be required for the sides, &amp;c., and from
4 to 5 weeks for the hams. On taking
the pieces out, let them drain for an
hour, cover with dry sawdust, and smoke
from a fortnight to three weeks. Boil
and carefully skim the pickle after using,
and it will keep good, closely corked, for
2 years. When boiling it for use, add
about 2 lbs. of common salt, and the
same of treacle, to allow for waste.
Tongues are excellent put into this pickle
cold, having been first rubbed well with
saltpetre and salt, and allowed to remain
24 hours, not forgetting to make a deep
incision under the thick part of the
tongue, so as to allow the pickle to
penetrate more readily. A fortnight or
three weeks, according to the size of the
tongue, will be sufficient. <i>Time.</i>—Small
meat to remain in the pickle a fortnight,
hams 3 weeks; to be smoked from a fortnight
to 3 weeks.</p>


<h3>BACON, to Cure in the Wiltshire
way.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of coarse sugar, ½ lb.
of bay salt, 6 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of
common salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Sprinkle each flitch
with salt, and let the blood drain off for
24 hours; then pound and mix the above
ingredients well together and rub it well
into the meat, which should be turned
every day for a month; then hang it to
dry, and afterwards smoke it for 10 days.
<i>Time.</i>—To remain in the pickle from
three to four weeks, to be smoked 10
days, or rather longer.</p>


<h3>BACON, Fried Rashers of, and
Poached Eggs.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Bacon; eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the bacon into thin slices, trim away
the rusty parts, and cut off the rind. Put
it into a <i>cold</i> frying-pan, that is to say,
do not place the pan on the fire before the
bacon is in it. Turn it 2 or 3 times, and
dish it on a very hot dish. Poach the eggs
and slip them on to the bacon without
breaking the yolks, and serve quickly.
<i>Time.</i>—3 or 4 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i>
to 1<i>s.</i> per lb. for the primest parts.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 6 eggs for 3 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time. <i>Note.</i>—Fried
rashers of bacon, curled, serve as a
pretty garnish to many dishes; and, for
small families, answer very well as a
substitute for boiled bacon, to serve with
a small dish of poultry, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>The Bain Marie.</b>—It is an open
kind of vessel, as shown in the engraving,
and is a utensil much used in modern
cookery, both in English and French
kitchens. It is filled with boiling or nearly
boiling water; and into this water should
be put all the stewpans containing those
ingredients which it is desired to keep
hot. The quantity and quality of the
contents of these vessels are not at all
affected; and if the hour of dinner is
uncertain in any establishment, by reason
of the nature of the master’s business,
nothing is so sure a means of preserving
the flavour of all dishes as the employment
of the bain marie.</p>

<h3>BARBEL.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of port wine, a
saltspoonful of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, 2 sliced onions, a faggot of
sweet herbs, nutmeg and mace to taste,
the juice of a lemon, 2 anchovies; 1 or
2 barbels, according to size. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the barbels in salt and water till
done; pour off some of the water, and
to the remainder put the ingredients
mentioned above. Simmer gently for ½
hour or rather more, and strain. Put in
the fish, heat it gradually, but do not let
it boil, or it will be broken. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether
1 hour. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from September to November.</p>


<h3>BARBERRIES (Berberis vulgaris).</h3>

<p>A fruit of such great acidity, that even
birds refuse to eat it. In this respect, it
nearly approaches the tamarind. When
boiled with sugar, it makes a very agreeable
preserve or jelly, according to the
different modes of preparing it. Barberries
are also used as a dry sweetmeat, and
in sugarplums or comfits; are pickled with
vinegar, and are used for various culinary
purposes. They are well calculated to
allay heat and thirst in persons afflicted
with fevers. The berries, arranged on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
bunches of nicely curled parsley, make an
exceedingly pretty garnish for supper
dishes, particularly for white meats, like
boiled fowl à la Béchamel, the three
colours, scarlet, green, and white, contrasting
well, and producing a very good
effect.</p>


<h3>BARBERRIES, to preserve in
Bunches.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of syrup, barberries.
<i>Mode.</i>—Prepare some small pieces
of clean white wood, 3 inches long and
¼ inch wide, and tie the fruit on to
these in nice bunches. Have ready
some clear syrup (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#SYRUP">Syrup</a></span>); put in the
barberries, and simmer them in it for 2
successive days, boiling them for nearly
½ hour each day, and covering them each
time with the syrup when cold. When
the fruit looks perfectly clear it is sufficiently
done, and should be stowed away
in pots, with the syrup poured over, or the
fruit may be candied. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour to
simmer each day. <i>Seasonable</i> in autumn.</p>


<h3>BARLEY SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of shin of beef,
¼ lb. of pearl barley, a large bunch of
parsley, 4 onions, 6 potatoes, salt and
pepper, 4 quarts of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
in all the ingredients, and simmer gently
for 3 hours. <i>Time.</i>—3 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2½<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i> all the
year, but more suitable for winter.</p>


<h3>BARLEY-SUGAR, to make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of sugar
allow ½ pint of water, ½ the white of an
egg. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the sugar into a well-tinned
saucepan, with the water, and,
when the former is dissolved, set it over
a moderate fire, adding the well-beaten
egg before the mixture gets warm, and
stir it well together. When it boils,
remove the scum as it rises, and keep it
boiling until no more appears, and the
syrup looks perfectly clear; then strain
it through a fine sieve or muslin bag, and
put it back into the saucepan. Boil it
again like caramel, until it is brittle,
when a little is dropped in a basin of
cold water: it is then sufficiently boiled.
Add a little lemon-juice and a few drops
of essence of lemon, and let it stand for
a minute or two. Have ready a marble
slab or large dish, rubbed over with
salad-oil; pour on it the sugar, and cut
it into strips with a pair of scissors:
these strips should then be twisted, and
the barley-sugar stored away in a very
dry place. It may be formed into
lozenges or drops, by dropping the sugar
in a very small quantity at a time on to
the oiled slab or dish. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
sticks.</p>


<h3>BARLEY-WATER, to make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 oz. of pearl barley, 2
quarts of boiling water, 1 pint of cold
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the barley in cold
water; put it into a saucepan with the
above proportion of cold water, and when
it has boiled for about ¼ hour, strain off
the water, and add the 2 quarts of fresh
boiling water. Boil it until the liquid is
reduced one half; strain it, and it will
be ready for use. It may be flavoured
with lemon-peel, after being sweetened,
or a small piece may be simmered with
the barley. When the invalid may take
it, a little lemon-juice gives this pleasant
drink in illness a very nice flavour; as
does also a small quantity of port wine.
<i>Time.</i>—To boil until the liquid is reduced
one half. <i>Sufficient</i> to make 1 quart of
barley-water.</p>


<h3>BATTER PUDDING, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of milk, 4 tablespoonfuls
of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 4 eggs,
a little salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the flour with
a small quantity of cold milk; make the
remainder hot, and pour it on to the flour,
keeping the mixture well stirred; add the
butter, eggs, and salt; beat the whole
well, and put the pudding into a buttered
pie-dish; bake for ¾ hour, and serve with
sweet sauce, wine sauce, or stewed fruit.
Baked in small cups, very pretty little
puddings may be made; they should be
eaten with the same accompaniments as
above. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>BATTER PUDDING, Baked, with
Dried or Fresh Fruit.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of milk, 4 tablespoonfuls
of flour, 3 eggs, 2 oz. of finely-shredded
suet, ¼ lb. of currants, a pinch
of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the milk, flour, and
eggs to a smooth batter; add a little
salt, the suet, and the currants, which
should be well washed, picked, and dried;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
put the mixture into a buttered pie-dish,
and bake in a moderate oven for 1¼ hour.
When fresh fruits are in season, this
pudding is exceedingly nice, with damsons,
plums, red currants, gooseberries,
or apples; when made with these, the
pudding must be thickly sprinkled over
with sifted sugar. Boiled batter pudding,
with fruit, is made in the same manner,
by putting the fruit into a buttered basin,
and filling it up with batter made in the
above proportion, but omitting the suet.
It must be sent quickly to table, and
covered plentifully with sifted sugar.
<i>Time.</i>—Baked batter pudding, with fruit,
1¼ to 1½ hour; boiled ditto, 1½ to 1¾ hour,
allowing that both are made with the
above proportion of batter. Smaller puddings
will be done enough in ¾ or 1 hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time, with
dried fruits.</p>


<h3>BATTER PUDDING, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 eggs, 1 oz. of butter,
1 pint of milk, 3 tablespoonfuls of flour,
a little salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the flour into a
basin, and add sufficient milk to moisten
it; carefully rub down all the lumps with
a spoon, then pour in the remainder of
the milk, and stir in the butter, which
should be previously melted; keep beating
the mixture, add the eggs and a pinch
of salt, and, when the batter is quite
smooth, put it into a well-buttered basin,
tie it down very tightly, and put it into
boiling water; move the basin about for
a few minutes after it is put into the
water, to prevent the flour settling in any
part, and boil for 1¼ hour. This pudding
may also be boiled in a floured cloth that
has been wetted in hot water: it will
then take a few minutes less than when
boiled in a basin. Send batter puddings
very quickly to table, and serve with
sweet sauce, wine sauce, stewed fruit, or
jam of any kind: when the latter is used,
a little of it may be placed round the dish
in small quantities, as a garnish. <i>Time.</i>—1¼
hour in a basin, 1 hour in a cloth.
<i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BATTER PUDDING, with Orange
Marmalade.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, 1 pint of milk,

flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Make the batter with the
above ingredients, put it into a well-buttered
basin, tie it down with a cloth,
and boil for 1 hour. As soon as it is
turned out of the basin, put a small jar
of orange marmalade all over the top,
and send the pudding very quickly to
table. It is advisable to warm the marmalade
to make it liquid. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, with the marmalade, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time; but more suitable for a winter
pudding.</p>

<img src="images/illus-025.jpg" width="158" height="286" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">BROAD BEANS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each ½ gallon of
water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of
salt; beans. <i>Mode.</i>—This is a favourite
vegetable with many persons, but,
to be nice, should be young and
freshly gathered.
After shelling the
beans, put them
into <i>boiling</i> water,
salted in the above
proportion, and let
them boil rapidly
until tender.
Drain them well in
a colander; dish,
and serve with
them separately a
tureen of parsley
and butter. Boiled
bacon should
always accompany
this vegetable, but
the beans should be cooked separately.
It is usually served with the beans laid
round, and the parsley and butter in a
tureen. Beans also make an excellent
garnish to a ham, and when used for
this purpose, if very old, should have
their skins removed. <i>Time.</i>—Very
young beans, 15 minutes; when a moderate
size, 20 to 25 minutes, or longer.
<i>Average cost</i>, unshelled, 6<i>d.</i> per peck.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow one peck for 6 or 7
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in July and August.</p>


<h3>BEANS, Broad, à la Poulette.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 pints of broad beans,
½ pint of stock or broth, a small bunch
of savoury herbs, including parsley, a
small lump of sugar, the yolk of 1 egg,
¼ pint of cream, pepper and salt to taste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Procure some young and freshly-gathered
beans, and shell sufficient to
make 2 pints; boil them, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
preceding recipe, until nearly done; then
drain them and put them into a stewpan
with the stock, finely-minced herbs,
and sugar. Stew the beans until perfectly
tender, and the liquor has dried
away a little; then beat up the yolk of
an egg with the cream, add this to the
beans, let the whole get thoroughly hot,
and when on the point of simmering,
serve. Should the beans be very large,
the skin should be removed previously
to boiling them. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes to
boil the beans, 15 minutes to stew them
in the stock. <i>Average cost</i>, unshelled, 6<i>d.</i>
per peck. <i>Seasonable</i> in July and August.</p>


<h3>BEANS, Boiled French.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each ½ gallon of water
allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, a
very small piece of soda. <i>Mode.</i>—This
vegetable should always be eaten young,
as when allowed to grow too long it tastes
stringy and tough when cooked. Cut off
the heads and tails, and a thin strip on
each side of the beans to remove the
strings; then divide each bean into 4 or 6
pieces, according to size, cutting them
lengthways in a slanting direction, and
as they are cut put them into cold water,
with a small quantity of salt dissolved
in it. Have ready a saucepan of boiling
water, with salt and soda in the above
proportion; put in the beans, keep them
boiling quickly, with the lid uncovered,
and be careful that they do not get
smoked. When tender, which may be
ascertained by their sinking to the bottom
of the saucepan, take them up, pour
them into a colander, and when drained,
dish and serve with plain melted butter.
When very young, beans are sometimes
served whole: thus dressed, their colour
and flavour are much better preserved,
but the more general way of sending
them to table is to cut them into thin
strips. <i>Time.</i>—Very young beans, 10
to 12 minutes; moderate size, 15 to 20
minutes, after the water boils. <i>Average
cost</i>, in full season, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per peck, but
when forced very expensive. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
½ peck for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from the middle of July to the
end of September, but may be had forced
from February to the beginning of June.</p>


<h3>BEANS, French Mode of Cooking
French.</h3>

stewpan, and shake over the fire, to
dry away the moisture from the beans.
When quite dry and hot, add the butter,
pepper, salt, and lemon-juice; keep moving

<img src="images/illus-027.jpg" width="201" height="295" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">HARICOT BEANS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 quart of white haricot
beans, ¼ lb. of fresh butter, 1 tablespoonful
of minced parsley, pepper and salt to
taste, the juice of ½ lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Should
the beans be very dry, soak them
for an hour or two in cold water, and boil
them until perfectly tender, as in the preceding
recipe. If the water should boil
away, replenish it
with a little more
cold, which makes
the skin of the
beans tender. Let
them be very thoroughly
done; drain
them well; then
add to them the
butter, minced parsley,
and a seasoning
of pepper and
salt. Keep moving
the stewpan over
the fire without
using a spoon, as
this would break
the beans; and,
when the various ingredients are well
mixed with them, squeeze in the lemon-juice,
and serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—From
2 to 2½ hours to boil the beans. <i>Average

2 cloves, ½ bay-leaf, 1 small bunch of
savoury herbs, salt to taste; 3 or 4 mushrooms,
when obtainable; 2 pints of white
stock, 1 pint of milk or cream, 1 tablespoonful
of arrowroot. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the
stock into a stewpan, with the parsley,
cloves, bay-leaf, herbs, and mushrooms;
add a seasoning of salt, but no pepper, as
that would give the sauce a dusty appearance,
and should be avoided. When it has
boiled long enough to extract the flavour
of the herbs, &amp;c., strain it, and boil it
up quickly again, until it is nearly
half reduced. Now mix the arrowroot
smoothly with the milk or cream, and
let it simmer very gently for 5 minutes
over a slow fire; pour to it the stock,
and continue to simmer slowly for 10
minutes, if the sauce be thick. If, on
the contrary, it be too thin, it must be
stirred over a sharp fire till it thickens.

thinned with cream, milk, or white stock.
This sauce is excellent for pouring over
boiled fowls. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 2 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> per quart, with cream at
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per pint.</p>

the liquor, and stir it well till it boils up;
then place it by the side of the fire, and
continue stirring until it is perfectly
smooth. Now strain it through a sieve
into a basin, after which put it back in
the stewpan, and add the lemon-juice.
Beat up the yolks of the eggs with about
4 dessertspoonfuls of milk; strain this
to the sauce, keep stirring it over the
fire, <i>but do not let it boil, or it will curdle</i>.
<i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
5<i>d.</i> per pint.</p>

<p>This is a good sauce to pour over boiled
fowls when they are a bad colour.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Aitchbone of, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Beef, water. <i>Mode.</i>—After
this joint has been in salt 5 or 6
days, it will be ready for use, and will not
take so long boiling as a round, for it is
not so solid. Wash the meat, and, if too
salt, soak it for a few hours, changing
the water once or twice, till the required
freshness is obtained. Put into a saucepan,
or boiling-pot, sufficient water to
cover the meat; set it over the fire, and
when it boils, plunge in the joint, and
let it boil up quickly. Now draw the
pot to the side of the fire, and let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
process be very gradual, as the water
must only simmer, or the meat will be
hard and tough. Carefully remove the
scum from the surface of the water, and
continue doing this for a few minutes
after it first boils. Carrots and turnips
are served with this dish, and sometimes
suet dumplings, which may be boiled
with the beef. Garnish with a few of
the carrots and turnips, and serve the
remainder in a vegetable-dish. <i>Time.</i>—An
aitchbone of 10 lbs., 2½ hours after
the water boils; one of 20 lbs., 4 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—10
lbs. for 7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year, but best from September to
March.</p>

<div class="caption">AITCH-BONE OF BEEF.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The liquor in which the meat
has been boiled may be easily converted
into a very excellent pea-soup. It will
require very few vegetables, as it will be
impregnated with the flavour of those
boiled with the meat.</p>


<h3>BEEF À LA MODE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 or 7 lbs. of the thick
flank of beef, a few slices of fat bacon,
1 teacupful of vinegar, black pepper,
allspice, 2 cloves well mixed and finely
pounded, making altogether 1 heaped
teaspoonful; salt to taste, 1 bunch
of savoury herbs, including parsley, all
finely minced and well mixed; 3 onions,
2 large carrots, 1 turnip, 1 head of
celery, 1½ pint of water, 1 glass of
port wine. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice and fry the
onions of a pale brown, and cut up the
other vegetables in small pieces, and
prepare the beef for stewing in the following
manner:—Choose a fine piece of
beef, cut the bacon into long slices,
about an inch in thickness, dip them
into vinegar, and then into a little of the
above seasoning of spice, &amp;c., mixed
with the same quantity of minced herbs.
With a sharp knife make holes deep
enough to let in the bacon; then rub
the beef over with the remainder of the
seasoning and herbs, and bind it up in
a nice shape with tape. Have ready a
well-tinned stewpan (it should not be
much larger than the piece of meat you
are cooking), into which put the beef,
with the vegetables, vinegar, and water.
Let it simmer <i>very gently</i> for 5 hours, or
rather longer, should the meat not be
extremely tender, and turn it once or
twice. When ready to serve, take out
the beef, remove the tape, and put it on
a hot dish. Skim off every particle of
fat from the gravy, add the port wine,
just let it boil, pour it over the beef, and
it is ready to serve. Great care must be
taken that this does not boil fast, or the
meat will be tough and tasteless; it
should only just bubble. When convenient,
all kinds of stews, &amp;c. should
be cooked on a hot plate, as the process
is so much more gradual than on an
open fire. <i>Time.</i>—5 hours, or rather
more. <i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all
the year, but more suitable for a winter
dish.</p>

pieces, and roll them in flour; put the
dripping into a stewpan with the onion,
which should be sliced thin. Let it get
quite hot; lay in the pieces of beef, and
stir them well about. When nicely
browned all over, add <i>by degrees</i> boiling

<h3>BEEF CARVING.</h3>

<p><b>Beef, Aitchbone of.</b>—A boiled
aitchbone of beef is not a difficult joint
to carve, as will be seen on reference to
the accompanying engraving. By following
with the knife the direction of the
line from 1 to 2, nice slices will be easily
cut. It may be necessary, as in a round
of beef, to cut a thick slice off the outside
before commencing to serve.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/illus-031a.jpg" width="257" height="143" alt="drawing of slab of beef" />
</div>

<p><b>Beef, Brisket of.</b>—There is but
little description necessary to add to
show the carving of a boiled brisket of
beef beyond the engraving here inserted.
The only point to be observed is, that
the joint should be cut evenly and firmly
quite across the bones, so that on its
reappearance at table it should not have
a jagged and untidy look.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 286px;">
<img src="images/illus-031b.jpg" width="286" height="118" alt="different slab" />
</div>

<p><b>Beef, Ribs of.</b>—This dish resembles
the sirloin, except that it has no fillet or
undercut. As explained in the recipes,
the end piece is often cut off, salted and
boiled. The mode of carving is similar to
that of the sirloin, viz., in the direction of
the dotted line from 1 to 2. This joint
will be the more easily cut if the plan be
pursued which is suggested in carving the
sirloin; namely, the inserting of the knife
immediately between the bone and the
meat, before commencing to cut it into
slices. All joints of roast beef should be
cut in even and thin slices. Horseradish,
finely scraped, may be served as a garnish;
but horseradish sauce is preferable for
eating with the beef.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 236px;">
<img src="images/illus-031c.jpg" width="236" height="117" alt="another slab with diagram letters" />
</div>

<p><b>Beef, a Round of.</b>—A round of
beef is more easily carved than any other
joint of beef, but, to manage it properly,
a thin-bladed and very sharp knife is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>necessary. Off the outside of the joint,
at its top, a thick slice should first be cut,
so as to leave the surface smooth: then
thin and even slices should be cleverly
carved in the direction of the line 1 to 2;
and with each slice of the lean a delicate
morsel of the fat should be served.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/illus-031d.jpg" width="257" height="134" alt="looks like the collared beef above" />
</div>

<p><b>Beef, Sirloin of.</b>—This dish is
served differently at various tables, some
preferring it to come to table with the
fillet, or, as it is usually called, the
undercut, uppermost. The reverse way,
as shown in the cut, is that most usually
adopted. Still the undercut is best eaten
when hot; consequently, the carver himself
may raise the joint, and cut some
slices from the under side, in the direction
of from 1 to 2, as the fillet is very much
preferred by some eaters. The upper
part of the sirloin should be cut in the
direction of the line from 5 to 6, and care
should be taken to carve it evenly and in
thin slices. It will be found a great
assistance, in carving this joint well, if the
knife be first inserted just above the bone
at the bottom, and run sharply along
between the bone and meat, and also to
divide the meat from the bone in the
same way at the side of the joint;
the slices will then come away more
readily. Some carvers cut the upper side
of the sirloin across, as shown by the line
from 3 to 4; but this is a wasteful plan,
and one not to be recommended. With the
sirloin, very finely-scraped horseradish is
usually served, and a little given, when
liked, to each guest. Horseradish sauce
is preferable, however, for serving on the
plate, although the scraped horseradish
may still be used as a garnish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/illus-032a.jpg" width="246" height="148" alt="diagram of ribs" />
</div>

<p><b>Beef Tongue.</b>—Passing the knife
down in the direction of from 1 to 2, a
not too thin slice should be helped; and
the carving of a tongue may be continued
in this way until the best portions of the
upper side are served. The fat which
lies about the root can be served by turning
the tongue, and cutting in the direction
of from 3 to 4.</p>

<h3>BEEF, Curried.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—A
few slices of tolerably lean cold roast
or boiled beef, 3 oz. of butter, 2 onions,
1 wineglassful of beer, a dessertspoonful
of curry powder. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the beef
into pieces about 1 inch square, put the
butter into a stewpan with the onions
sliced, and fry them of a light-brown
colour. Add all the other ingredients, and
stir gently over a brisk fire for about 10
minutes. Should this be thought too dry,
more beer, or a spoonful or two of gravy

<i>Mode.</i>—Lard the beef with bacon, and
put it into a pan with sufficient vinegar
to cover it, with an onion sliced, parsley,
and seasoning, and let it remain in this
pickle for 12 hours. Roast it before a
nice clear fire for about 1¼ hour, and,
when done, glaze it. Pour some Spanish
sauce round the beef, and the remainder
serve in a tureen. It may be garnished
with Spanish onions boiled and glazed.
<i>Time.</i>—1¼ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the sauce, 4<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 8
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Fricandeau of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—About 3 lbs. of the inside
fillet of the sirloin (a piece of the rump
may be substituted for this), pepper and
salt to taste, 3 cloves, 2 blades of mace, 6
whole allspice, 1 pint of stock (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#STOCKS">Stock</a></span>),
or water, 1 glass of sherry, 1 bunch of
savoury herbs, 2 shalots, bacon. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
some bacon into thin strips, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
sprinkle over them a seasoning of pepper
and salt, mixed with cloves, mace, and
allspice, well pounded. Lard the beef with
these, put it into a stewpan with the stock
or water, sherry, herbs, shalots, 2 cloves,
and more pepper and salt. Stew the meat
gently until tender, when take it out,
cover it closely, skim off all the fat from
the gravy, and strain it. Set it on
the fire, and boil, till it becomes a glaze.
Glaze the larded side of the beef with this,
and serve on sorrel sauce, which is
made as follows:—Wash and pick some
sorrel, and put it into a stewpan with
only the water that hangs about it. Keep
stirring, to prevent its burning, and when
done, lay it in a sieve to drain. Chop it,
and stew it with a small piece of butter
and 4 or 5 tablespoonfuls of good gravy,
for an hour, and rub it through a sieve.
If too acid, add sugar; a little cabbage-lettuce
boiled with the sorrel will be
found an improvement. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours
to gently stew the meat. <i>Average cost</i>,
for this quantity, 4<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

remains of cold roast beef, pepper
and salt to taste, ¾ lb. of flour, ½ pint of
water, 2 oz. of butter, the whites of
2 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix very smoothly,
and, by degrees, the flour with the above
proportion of water; stir in 2 oz. of butter,
which must be melted but not oiled,
and, just before it is to be used, add the
whites of two well-whisked eggs. Should
the batter be too thick, more water must
be added. Pare down the cold beef into
thin shreds, season with pepper and salt,
and mix it with the batter.  Drop a
small quantity at a time into a pan of
boiling lard, and fry from 7 to 10 minutes,
according to the size. When
done on one side, turn and brown them
on the other. Let them dry for a minute
or two before the fire, and serve on a
folded napkin. A small quantity of
finely-minced onions, mixed with the
batter, is an improvement. <i>Time.</i>—From
7 to 10 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
exclusive of the meat, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Hashed.</h3>

thin slices, dredge them with flour, and
lay them in the gravy; let the whole
simmer gently for 5 minutes, but not boil,
or the meat will be tough and hard. Serve
very hot, and garnish with sippets of
toasted bread. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes.
Average cost, exclusive of the cold meat,
4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

bones of ribs or sirloin of beef; remove
the outside brown and gristle; place
the meat on one side, and well stew
the bones and pieces, with the above
ingredients, for about 2 hours, till it
becomes a strong gravy, and is reduced
to rather more than ½ pint; strain this,
thicken with a teaspoonful of flour, and
let the gravy cool; skim off all the fat; lay
in the meat, let it get hot through, but
do not allow it to boil; and garnish with
sippets of toasted bread. The gravy
should be flavoured as in the preceding
recipe. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more than 2
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the
cold meat, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Either of the above recipes may
be served in walls of mashed potatoes
browned; in which case the sippets should
be omitted. <i>Be careful that hashed meat
does not boil, or it will become tough.</i></p>


<h3>BEEF, Hunter’s.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—For a round of beef
weighing 25 lbs. allow 3 oz. of saltpetre,
3 oz. of coarse sugar, 1 oz. of cloves,
1 grated nutmeg, ½ oz. of allspice, 1 lb.
of salt, ½ lb. bay-salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Hang
the beef for 2 or 3 days, and remove
the bone. Pound spices, salt, &amp;c. in
the above proportion, and let them be
reduced to the finest powder. Put the
beef into a pan, rub all the ingredients
well into it, and turn and rub it every
day for rather more than a fortnight.
When it has been sufficiently long in
pickle, wash the meat, bind it up securely
with tape, and put it into a pan
with ½ pint of water at the bottom; mince
some suet, cover the top of the meat with
it, and over the pan put a common crust
of flour and water; bake for 6 hours, and
when cold remove the paste. Save the
gravy that flows from it, as it adds
greatly to the flavour of hashes, stews,
&amp;c. The beef may be glazed and
garnished with meat jelly. <i>Time.</i>—6
hours. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—In salting or pickling beef or
pork for family consumption, it not being
generally required to be kept for a great
length of time, a less quantity of salt and
a larger quantity of other matters more
adapted to retain mellowness in meat,
may be employed, which could not be
adopted by the curer of the immense
quantities of meat required to be preserved
for victualling the shipping of this
maritime country. Sugar, which is well
known to possess the preserving principle
in a very great degree, without the
pungency and astringency of salt, may
be, and is, very generally used in the
preserving of meat for family consumption.
Although it acts without corrugating or
contracting the fibres of meat, as is the
case in the action of salt, and, therefore,
does not impair its mellowness, yet its
use in sufficient quantities for preservative
effect, without the addition of other
antiseptics, would impart a flavour not
agreeable to the taste of many persons.
It may be used, however, together with
salt, with the greatest advantage in
imparting mildness and mellowness to
cured meat, in a proportion of about one
part by weight to four of the mixture;
and, perhaps, now that sugar is so much
lower in price than it was in former
years, one of the obstructions to its more
frequent use is removed.</p>


<h3>BEEF KIDNEY, to Dress.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 kidney, clarified butter,
pepper and salt to taste, a small
quantity of highly-seasoned gravy, 1 tablespoonful
of lemon-juice, ¼ teaspoonful
of powdered sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the
kidneys into neat slices, put them into
warm water to soak for two hours, and
change the water 2 or 3 times; then lay
them on a clean cloth to dry the water
from them, place them in a frying-pan
with some clarified butter, and fry
them of a nice brown; season each side
with pepper and salt, put them round
the dish, with the gravy in the middle.
Before pouring the gravy in the dish,
add the lemon-juice and sugar. <i>Time.</i>—From
5 to 10 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i>
each. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF KIDNEY, to Dress.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 kidney, 1 dessertspoonful
of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of
minced shalot, salt and pepper to taste;
¼ pint of gravy (follow one of the gravy
recipes), 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry.
<i>Mode.</i>—Take off a little of the kidney
fat, mince it very fine, and put it in a
frying-pan; slice the kidney, sprinkle
over it parsley and shalots in the above
proportion, add a seasoning of pepper
and salt, and fry it of a nice brown.
When it is done enough, dredge over a
little flour, and pour in the gravy and
sherry. Let it just simmer, but not
boil any more, or the kidney would
harden; serve very hot, and garnish
with croûtons. Where the flavour of the
shalot is disliked it may be omitted, and
a small quantity of savoury herbs substituted
for it. <i>Time.</i>—From 5 to 10 minutes,
according to the thickness of the
slices. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 3 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF KIDNEY, to Dress (a more
simple method).</h3>

<p>Cut the kidneys into thin slices, flour
them, and fry of a nice brown. When
done, make a gravy in the pan by pouring
away the fat, putting in a small piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of butter, ¼ pint of boiling water, pepper
and salt, a dessertspoonful of lemon-juice,
and a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.

kidney, and serve.</p>


<h3>BEEF MARROW-BONES, Boiled.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 242px;">
<img src="images/illus-035.jpg" width="242" height="123" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">MARROW-BONES.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Bones, a small piece of
common paste, a floured cloth. <i>Mode.</i>—Have
the bones neatly sawed into convenient
sizes, and cover the ends with a
small piece
of common
crust, made
with flour
and water.
Over this tie
a floured
cloth, and
place them
upright in a saucepan of boiling water,
taking care there is sufficient to cover
the bones. Boil the bones for 2 hours,
remove the cloth and paste, and serve
them upright on a napkin with dry toast.
Many persons clear the marrow from the
bones after they are cooked, spread it
over a slice of toast, and add a seasoning
of pepper; when served in this manner,
it must be very expeditiously sent to
table, as it so soon gets cold. <i>Time.</i>—2
hours. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Marrow-bones may be baked
after preparing them as in the preceding
recipe; they should be laid in a deep
dish, and baked for 2 hours.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Minced.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—1
oz. of butter, 1 small onion, 12 tablespoonfuls
of gravy left from the meat,
1 tablespoonful of strong ale, 1 teaspoonful
of flour, salt and pepper to
taste, a few slices of lean roast beef.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put into a stewpan the butter
with an onion chopped fine; add the
gravy, ale, and a teaspoonful of flour to
thicken; season with pepper and salt,
and stir these ingredients over the fire
until the onion is a rich brown. Cut (but
do not chop) the meat <i>very fine</i>, add it to
the gravy, stir till quite hot, and serve.
Garnish with sippets of toasted bread.
Be careful in not allowing the gravy to
boil after the meat is added, as it would
render it hard and tough. <i>Time.</i>—About
½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the
meat, 3<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Minced Collops of (an

bunch of savoury herbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince
the beef and onion very small, and
fry the latter in butter until of a pale
brown. Put all the ingredients together
in a stewpan, and boil gently for about
10 minutes; garnish with sippets of
toasted bread, and serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per lb.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 2 or 3 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Miroton of.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—A
few slices of cold roast beef, 3 oz. of
butter, salt and pepper to taste, 3 onions,
½ pint of gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice the onions
and put them into the frying-pan with
the cold beef and butter; place it over
the fire, and keep turning and stirring
the ingredients to prevent them burning.
When a pale brown, add the gravy and
seasoning; let it simmer for a few minutes,
and serve very hot. The dish is excellent
and economical. <i>Time.</i>—5 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the meat, 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF OLIVES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of rump-steak,
1 egg, 1 tablespoonful of minced savoury
herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of
stock, 2 or 3 slices of bacon, 2 tablespoonfuls
of any kind of store sauce, a
slight thickening of butter and flour.
Mode.—Have the steaks cut rather thin,
beat them to make them level, cut them
into 6 or 7 pieces, brush over with egg,
and sprinkle with herbs, which should be
very finely minced; season with pepper
and salt, roll up the pieces tightly, and
fasten with a small skewer. Put the stock
in a stewpan that will exactly hold the ingredients,
for, by being pressed together,
they will keep their shape better; lay in
the rolls of meat, cover them with the
bacon, cut in thin slices, and over that
put a piece of paper. Stew them very
<i>gently</i> for full 2 hours; for the slower
they are done the better. Take them
out, remove the skewers, thicken the
gravy with butter and flour, and flavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
with any store sauce that may be preferred.
Give one boil, pour over the
meat, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per pound. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4
or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF OLIVES (Economical).</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of underdone cold roast
beef, bread-crumbs, 1 shalot finely
minced, pepper and salt to taste, gravy
made from the beef bones, thickening
of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful
of mushroom ketchup. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
some slices of underdone roast beef about
half an inch thick; sprinkle over them
some bread-crumbs, minced shalot, and
a little of the fat and seasoning; roll
them, and fasten with a small skewer.
Have ready some gravy made from the
beef bones; put in the pieces of meat,
and stew them till tender, which will be
in about 1¼ hour, or rather longer. Arrange
the meat in a dish, thicken and
flavour the gravy, and pour it over the
meat, when it is ready to serve. <i>Time.</i>—1½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the
beef, 2<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF PALATES, to Dress (an
Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 palates, sufficient
gravy to cover them, cayenne to taste,
1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup,
1 tablespoonful of pickled-onion liquor,
thickening of butter and flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
the palates, and put them
into a stewpan, with sufficient water to
cover them, and let them boil until perfectly
tender, or until the upper skin
may be easily peeled off. Have ready
sufficient gravy to cover them; add a
good seasoning of cayenne, and thicken
with a little butter kneaded with
flour; let it boil up, and skim. Cut the
palates into square pieces, put them in
the gravy, and let them simmer gently
for ½ hour; add ketchup and onion-liquor,
give one boil, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—From
3 to 5 hours to boil the palates.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Palates may be dressed in various
ways with good onion sauce,
tomato sauce, &amp;c., &amp;c., and may also be
served in a <i>vol-au-vent</i>; but the above
will be found a more simple method of
dressing them.</p>


<h3>BEEF PICKLE. (This may also
be used for any kind of Meat,
Tongues, or Hams.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 lbs. of salt, 2 lbs. of
fine sugar, 3 oz. of powdered saltpetre,
3 gallons of spring water. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
all the ingredients gently together, so
long as any scum or impurity arises,
which carefully remove; when quite
cold, pour it over the meat, every part of
which must be covered with the brine.
This may be used for pickling any kind
of meat, and may be kept for some time,
if boiled up occasionally with an addition
of the ingredients. <i>Time.</i>—A ham should
be kept in pickle for a fortnight; a piece
of beef weighing 14 lbs., 12 or 15 days; a
tongue, 10 days or a fortnight.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—For salting and pickling meat,
it is a good plan to rub in only half the
quantity of salt directed, and to let it
remain for a day or two to disgorge and
effectually to get rid of the blood and
slime; then rub in the remainder of the
salt and other ingredients, and proceed
as above. This rule may be applied to
all recipes for salting and pickling meat.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Potted.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 207px;">
<img src="images/illus-036.jpg" width="207" height="112" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">JAR FOR POTTED MEATS.</div>
</div>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span> 1.] <i>Ingredients.</i>—2
lbs. of lean beef, 1 tablespoonful of
water, ¼ lb. of butter, a seasoning to
taste of salt, cayenne, pounded mace,
and black pepper. <i>Mode.</i>—Procure a
nice piece of
lean beef, as
free as possible
from gristle,
skin, &amp;c., and
put it into a jar
(if at hand, one
with a lid) with
1 tablespoonful
of water.
Cover it <i>closely</i>, and put the jar into a
saucepan of boiling water, letting the
water come within 2 inches of the top of
the jar. Boil gently for 3½ hours, then
take the beef, chop it very small with a
chopping-knife, and pound it thoroughly
in a mortar. Mix with it by degrees all,
or a portion, of the gravy that will have
run from it, and a little clarified butter;
add the seasoning, put it in small pots
for use, and cover with a little butter
just warmed and poured over. If much
gravy is added to it, it will keep but a
short time; on the contrary, if a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
proportion of butter is used, it may be
preserved for some time. <i>Time.</i>—3½
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity,
1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span> 2.] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast or boiled beef,
¼ lb. of butter, cayenne to taste, 2 blades
of pounded mace. <i>Mode.</i>—The outside
slices of boiled beef may, with a little
trouble, be converted into a very nice
addition to the breakfast-table. Cut up
the meat into small pieces and pound it
well, with a little butter, in a mortar;
add a seasoning of cayenne and mace,
and be very particular that the latter
spice is reduced to the finest powder.
When all the ingredients are
thoroughly mixed, put them into glass or
earthen potting-pots, and pour on the
top a coating of clarified butter. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—If cold <i>roast</i> beef is used, remove
all pieces of gristle and dry outside
pieces, as these do not pound well.</p>


<h3>BEEF RAGOÛT.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—About
2 lbs. of cold roast beef, 6 onions,
pepper, salt, and mixed spices to taste;
½ pint of boiling water, 3 tablespoonfuls
of gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the beef into
rather large pieces, and put them into
a stewpan with the onions, which must
be sliced. Season well with pepper, salt,
and mixed spices, and pour over about ½
pint of boiling water, and gravy in the
above proportion (gravy saved from the
meat answers the purpose); let the whole
stew very gently for about 2 hours, and
serve with pickled walnuts, gherkins, or
capers, just warmed in the gravy. <i>Time.</i>—2
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the
meat, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Rib-bones of (a pretty Dish).</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—Ribs
of beef bones, 1 onion chopped
fine, a few slices of carrot and turnip,
¼ pint of gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—The bones
for this dish should have left on them
a slight covering of meat; saw them
into pieces 3 inches long; season them
with pepper and salt, and put them into
a stewpan with the remaining ingredients.
Stew gently, until the vegetables
are tender, and serve on a flat dish within
walls of mashed potatoes, <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the bones, 2<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Roast Ribs of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Beef, a little salt. <i>Mode.</i>—The
fore-rib is considered the primest
roasting piece, but the middle-rib is considered
the most economical. Let the
meat be well hung (should the weather
permit), having previously cut off the
ends of the bones, which should be
salted for a few days, and then boiled.
Put the meat down to a nice clear fire,
with some clean dripping in the pan,
dredge the joint with a little flour, and
keep continually basting it all the time
it is cooking. Sprinkle some fine salt
over it (this must never be done until
the joint is dished, as it draws the
juices from the meat); pour the dripping
from the pan, put in a little
boiling water, and <i>strain</i> the gravy over
the meat. Garnish with tufts of scraped
horseradish, and send horseradish sauce
to table with it. A Yorkshire pudding
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#PUDDING_Yorkshire">Puddings</a></span>) sometimes accompanies
this dish, and, if lightly made and well
cooked, will be found a very agreeable
addition. <i>Time.</i>—10 lbs. of beef, 2½
hours; 14 to 16 lbs., from 3½ to 4 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—A
joint of 10 lbs. sufficient for 8 or 9 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Roast Ribs of, Boned and
Rolled (a very convenient Joint
for a small Family).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 or 2 ribs of beef.
<i>Mode.</i>—Choose a fine rib of beef, and
have it cut according to the weight
you require, either wide or narrow.
Bone and roll the meat round, secure
it with wooden skewers, and, if necessary,
bind it round with a piece of tape.
Spit the beef firmly, or, if a bottle-jack
is used, put the joint on the hook,
and place it <i>near</i> a nice clear fire. Let
it remain so till the outside of the meat
is set, when draw it to a distance, and
keep continually basting until the meat
is done, which can be ascertained by the
steam from it drawing towards the fire.
As this joint is solid, rather more than
¼ hour must be allowed for each lb.
Remove the skewers, put in a plated or
silver one, and send the joint to table
with gravy in the dish, and garnish with
tufts of horseradish. Horseradish sauce
is a great improvement to roast beef.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<i>Time.</i>—For 10 lbs. of the rolled ribs, 3
hours (as the joint is very solid, we have
allowed an extra ½ hour); for 6 lbs., 1½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—A
joint of 10 lbs. for 6 or 8
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When the weight exceeds 10
lbs., we would not advise the above
method of boning or rolling; only in the
case of 1 or 2 ribs, when the joint cannot
stand upright in the dish, and would
look awkwardly. The bones should be
put on with a few vegetables and herbs,
and made into stock.</p>


<h3>BEEF RISSOLES.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast beef; to
each pound of meat allow ¾ lb. of bread-crumbs,
salt and pepper to taste, a few
chopped savoury herbs, ½ a teaspoonful
of minced lemon-peel, 1 or 2 eggs, according
to the quantity of meat. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince
the beef very fine, which should
be rather lean, and mix with this bread-crumbs,
herbs, seasoning, and lemon-peel,
in the above proportion, to each
pound of meat. Make all into a thick
paste with 1 or 2 eggs; divide into balls
or cones, and fry a rich brown. Garnish
the dish with fried parsley, and send
to table some good brown gravy in
a tureen. Instead of garnishing with
fried parsley, gravy may be poured in
the dish round the rissoles; in this case,
it will not be necessary to send any in a
tureen. <i>Time.</i>—From 5 to 10 minutes,
according to size. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the meat, 5<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Rolled, to eat like Hare.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—About 5 lbs. of the inside
of the sirloin, 2 glasses of port
wine, 2 glasses of vinegar, a small quantity
of forcemeat, 1 teaspoonful of
pounded allspice. <i>Mode.</i>—Take the inside
of a large sirloin, soak it in 1 glass
of port wine and 1 glass of vinegar,
mixed, and let it remain for 2 days.
Make a forcemeat (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#FORCEMEATS">Forcemeat</a></span>), lay
it on the meat, and bind it up securely.
Roast it before a nice clear fire, and
baste it with 1 glass each of port wine
and vinegar, with which mix a teaspoonful
of pounded allspice. Serve, with a
good gravy in the dish, and send red-currant
jelly to table with it. <i>Time.</i>—A
piece of 5 lbs., about 1½ hour before a
brisk fire. <i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity,
5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF ROLLS.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast or boiled
beef, seasoning to taste of salt, pepper,
and minced herbs; puff paste. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince
the beef tolerably fine with a
<i>small</i> amount of its own fat; add a seasoning
of pepper, salt, and chopped
herbs; put the whole into a roll of puff
paste, and bake for ½ hour, or rather
longer, should the roll be very large.
Beef patties may be made of cold meat,
by mincing and seasoning beef as directed
above, and baking in a rich puff
paste in patty-tins. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Boiled Round of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Beef, water. <i>Mode.</i>—As
a whole round of beef, generally speaking,
is too large for small families, and very
seldom required, we here give the recipe
for dressing a portion of the silver side
of the round. Take from 12 to 16 lbs.,
after it has been in salt about 10 days;
just wash off the salt, skewer it up in a
nice round-looking form, and bind it with
tape to keep the skewers in their places.
Put it in a saucepan of boiling water,
set it upon a good fire, and when it
begins to boil, carefully remove all scum
from the surface, as, if this is not attended
to, it sinks on to the meat, and,
when brought to table, presents a very
unsightly appearance. After it is well
skimmed, draw the pot to the corner of
the fire, allow the liquor to cool, then
let the beef simmer very gently until
done. Remove the tape and skewers,
which should be replaced by a silver
one; pour over a little of the pot-liquor,
and garnish with carrots. Carrots,
turnips, parsnips, and sometimes
suet dumplings, accompany this dish;
and these may all be boiled with the
beef. The pot-liquor should be saved,
and converted into pea-soup; and the
outside slices, which are generally hard,
and of an uninviting appearance, may be
cut off before being sent to table, and
potted. These make an excellent relish
for the breakfast or luncheon table.
<i>Time.</i>—Part of a round of beef weighing
12 lbs., about 3 hours after the water
boils. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for 10 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year,
but more suitable for winter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Soyer’s Recipe for Preserving the
Gravy in Salt Meat, when it is to be
served Cold.</b>—Fill two tubs with cold
water, into which throw a few pounds of
rough ice; and when the meat is done,
put it into one of the tubs of ice-water;
let it remain 1 minute, when take out,
and put it into the other tub. Fill the first
tub again with water, and continue this
process for about 20 minutes; then set
it upon a dish, and let it remain until
quite cold. When cut, the fat will be
as white as possible, besides having
saved the whole of the gravy. If there
is no ice, spring water will answer the
same purpose, but will require to be
more frequently changed.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The brisket and rump may be
boiled by the above recipe; of course
allowing more or less time, according to
the size of the joint.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Miniature Round of (an excellent
Dish for a small Family).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—From 5 to 10 lbs. of ribs
of beef, sufficient brine to cover the meat.
<i>Mode.</i>—Choose a fine rib, have the bone
removed, rub some salt over the inside,
and skewer the meat up into a nice round
form, and bind it with tape. Put it into
sufficient brine to cover it (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#PICKLE_for_Tongues_or_Beef">Beef
Pickle</a></span>), and let it remain for 6 days, turning
the meat every day. When required to
be dressed, drain from the pickle, and
put the meat into very hot water; boil it
rapidly for a few minutes, then draw
the pot to the side of the fire, and simmer
the beef very gently until done. Remove
the skewer, and replace it by a plated
or silver one. Carrots and turnips should
be served with this dish, and may be
boiled with the meat. <i>Time.</i>—A small
round of 8 lbs., about 2 hours after the
water boils; one of 12 lbs., about 3 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for
6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Should the joint be very small,
4 or 5 days will be sufficient time to
salt it.</p>


<h3>BEEF, to Pickle part of a Round,
for Hanging.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—For 14 lbs. of a round of
beef allow 1½ lb. of salt, ½ oz. of powdered
saltpetre; or, 1 lb. of salt, ½ lb. of sugar,
½ oz. of powdered saltpetre. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub
in, and sprinkle either of the above
mixtures on 14 lbs. of meat. Keep it in
an earthenware pan, or a deep wooden
tray, and turn twice a week during 3
weeks; then bind up the beef tightly
with coarse linen tape, and hang it in a
kitchen in which a fire is constantly
kept, for 3 weeks. Pork, hams, and
bacon may be cured in a similar way,
but will require double the quantity of
the salting mixture; and, if not smoke-dried,
they should be taken down from
hanging after 3 or 4 weeks, and afterwards
kept in boxes or tubs, amongst
dry oat-husks. <i>Time.</i>—2 or 3 weeks to
remain in the brine, to be hung 3 weeks.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The meat may be boiled fresh
from this pickle, instead of smoking it.</p>


<h3>BEEF SAUSAGES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of suet allow
2 lbs. of lean beef; seasoning to taste of
salt, pepper, and mixed spices. <i>Mode.</i>—Clear
the suet from skin, and chop
that and the beef as finely as possible;
season with pepper, salt, and spices, and
mix the whole well together. Make it
into flat cakes, and fry of a nice brown.
Many persons pound the meat in a mortar
after it is chopped, but this is not
necessary when the meat is minced
finely. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, for this quantity, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Roast Sirloin of.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/illus-039.jpg" width="305" height="158" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">ROAST SIRLOIN OF BEEF.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Beef, a little salt. <i>Mode.</i>—As
a joint cannot be well roasted without
a good fire, see that it is well made
up about ¾ hour before it is required, so
that when the joint is put down, it is
clear and bright. Choose a nice sirloin,
the weight of which should not exceed
16 lbs., as the outside would be too
much done, whilst the inside would not be
done enough. Spit it or hook it on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
jack firmly, dredge it slightly with flour,
and place it near the fire at first. Then
draw it to a distance, and keep continually
basting until the meat is done.
Dish the meat, sprinkle a small quantity
of salt over it, empty the dripping-pan
of all the dripping, pour in some boiling
water, stir it about, and <i>strain</i> over the
meat. Garnish with tufts of horseradish,
and send horseradish sauce and Yorkshire
pudding to table with it. <i>Time.</i>—A
sirloin of 10 lbs., 2½ hours; 14 to 16 lbs.,
about 4 or 4½ hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 8½<i>d.</i>
per lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—A joint of 10 lbs. for
8 or 9 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.
The rump, round, and other pieces of beef
are roasted in the same manner, allowing
for solid joints ¼ hour to every lb.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The above is the usual method
of roasting meat; but to have it in perfection
and the juices kept in, the meat
should at first be laid <i>close</i> to the fire,
and when the outside is set and firm,
drawn away to a good distance, and then
left to roast very slowly. Where economy
is studied, this plan would not answer,
as the meat requires to be at the fire
double the time of the ordinary way of
cooking; consequently, double the quantity
of fuel would be consumed.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Sliced and Broiled (a pretty
Dish).</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—A
few slices of cold roast beef, 4 or 5
potatoes, a thin batter, pepper and salt
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare the potatoes as
you would peel an apple; fry the parings
in a thin batter seasoned with salt and
pepper, until they are of a light brown
colour, and place them on a dish over
some slices of beef, which should be
nicely seasoned and broiled. <i>Time.</i>—5
minutes to broil the meat. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Spiced (to serve Cold).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—14 lbs. of the thick flank
or rump of beef, ½ lb. of coarse sugar, 1 oz.
of saltpetre, ¼ lb. of pounded allspice,
1 lb. of common salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub the
sugar well into the beef, and let it lie for
12 hours; then rub the saltpetre and
allspice, both of which should be pounded,
over the meat, and let it remain for
another 12 hours; then rub in the salt.
Turn daily in the liquor for a fortnight,
soak it for a few hours in water, dry
with a cloth, cover with a coarse paste,
put a little water at the bottom of the
pan, and bake in a moderate oven for
4 hours. If it is not covered with a
paste, be careful to put the beef into a
deep vessel, and cover with a plate, or
it will be too crisp. During the time
the meat is in the oven it should be
turned once or twice. <i>Time.</i>—4 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Stewed. (A Polish Dish.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A thick beef or rump-steak
of about 2 lbs., an onion, some bread-crumbs,
pepper and salt, ¼ lb. of butter.
<i>Mode.</i>—Mince the onion fine, mix it
with the bread, pepper, and salt; make
deep incisions in the beef, but do not cut
it through; fill the spaces with the
bread, &amp;c. Roll up the steak and put it
in a stewpan with the butter; let it stew
very gently for more than two hours;
serve it with its own gravy, thickened
with a little flour, and flavoured, as may
be required, either with tomato sauce,
ketchup, or Harvey’s sauce. <i>Time.</i>—About
2 hours, or rather more. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Stewed Rump of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ rump of beef, sufficient
stock to cover it, 4 tablespoonfuls of
vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup,
1 bunch of savoury herbs, 2 onions, 12
cloves, pepper and salt to taste, thickening
of butter and flour, 1 glass of port
wine. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut out the bone, sprinkle
the meat with a little cayenne (this
must be sparingly used), and bind and
tie it firmly up with tape; put it into a
stewpan with sufficient stock to cover it,
add vinegar, ketchup, herbs, onions,
cloves, and seasonings in the above proportions,
and simmer very gently for 4
or 5 hours, or until the meat is perfectly
tender, which may be ascertained by
piercing it with a thin skewer. When
done, remove the tape, lay it into a deep
dish, which keep hot; strain and skim
the gravy, thicken it with butter and
flour, add a glass of port wine and
any flavouring to make the gravy rich
and palatable; let it boil up, pour over
the meat, and serve. This dish may be
very much enriched by garnishing with
forcemeat balls, or filling up the space
whence the bone is taken with a good
forcemeat; sliced carrots, turnips, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
onions boiled with the meat are also a
great improvement, and, where expense
is not objected to, it may be glazed. This,
however, is not necessary where a good
gravy is poured round and over the meat.
<i>Time.</i>—½ rump stewed gently from 4 to
5 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 8 or 10 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A stock or gravy in which to
boil the meat may be made of the bone
and trimmings, by boiling them with
water, and adding carrots, onions, turnips,
and a bunch of sweet herbs. To
make this dish richer and more savoury,
half-roast the rump, and afterwards stew
it in strong stock and a little Madeira.
This is an expensive method, and is not,
after all, much better than a plainer-dressed
joint.</p>


<h3>BEEF, Stewed Shin of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A shin of beef, 1 head of
celery, 1 onion, a faggot of savoury herbs,
½ teaspoonful of allspice, ½ teaspoonful of
whole black pepper, 4 carrots, 12 button
onions, 2 turnips, thickening of butter
and flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of mushroom
ketchup, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine;
pepper and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Have
the bone sawn into 4 or 5 pieces, cover
with hot water, bring it to a boil, and
remove any scum that may rise to the
surface. Put in the celery, onion, herbs,
spice, and seasoning, and simmer very
gently until the meat is tender. Peel
the vegetables, cut them into any shape
fancy may dictate, and boil them with
the onions until tender; lift out the
beef, put it on a dish, which keep hot,
and thicken with butter and flour as
much of the liquor as will be wanted for
gravy; keep stirring till it boils, then
strain and skim. Put the gravy back in
the stewpan, add the seasoning, port wine,
and ketchup, give one boil, and pour it
over the beef; garnish with the boiled
carrots, turnips and onions. <i>Time.</i>—The
meat to be stewed about 4 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> per lb. with bone.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>BEEF-TEA.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of lean gravy-beef,
1½ pint of water, 1 saltspoonful of salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—Have the meat cut without fat
and bone, and choose a nice fleshy piece.
Cut it into small pieces about the size of
dice, and put it into a clean saucepan.
Add the water <i>cold</i> to it; put it on the
fire, and bring it to the boiling-point;
then skim well. Put in the salt when
the water boils, and <i>simmer</i> the beef-tea
<i>gently</i> from ½ to ¾ hour, removing any
more scum should it appear on the surface.
Strain the tea through a hair
sieve, and set it by in a cool place. When
wanted for use, remove every particle of
fat from the top; warm up as much as
may be required, adding, if necessary, a
little more salt. This preparation is simple
beef-tea, and is to be administered
to those invalids to whom flavourings and
seasonings are not allowed. When the
patient is very weak, use double the quantity
of meat to the same proportion of
water. Should the invalid be able to
take the tea prepared in a more palatable
manner, it is easy to make it so by following
the directions in Soyer’s recipe,
which is an admirable one for making
savoury beef-tea. Beef-tea is always
better when made the day before it is
wanted, and then warmed up. It is a
good plan to put the tea into a small cup
or basin, and to place this basin in a
saucepan of boiling water. When the
tea is hot, it is ready to serve. <i>Time.</i>—½
to ¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per
pint. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1 lb. of meat for
a pint of <i>good</i> beef-tea.</p>


<h3>BEEF-TEA, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of fleshy beef, 1
pint of water, ½ saltspoonful of salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut the beef into small square
pieces, after trimming off all the fat, and
put it into a baking-jar (these jars are
sold expressly for the purpose of making
soups, gravies, &amp;c., in the oven, and are
arranged with tightly-fitting lids), with
the above proportion of water and salt;
close the jar well, place it in a warm but
not hot oven, and bake for 3 or 4 hours.
When the oven is very fierce in the day-time,
it is a good plan to put the jar in at
night, and let it remain till next morning,
when the tea will be done. It should
be strained, and put by in a cool place until
wanted. It may also be flavoured with
an onion, a clove, and a few sweet herbs,
&amp;c., when the stomach is sufficiently
strong to take these. <i>Time.</i>—3 or 4
hours, or to be left in the oven all night.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per pint. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
1 lb. of meat for 1 pint of good
beef-tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h3>BEEF-TEA, Savoury (Soyer’s
Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of solid beef, 1 oz.
of butter, 1 clove, 2 button onions or ½ a
large one, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1 quart
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the beef into very
small dice; put it into a stewpan with
the butter, clove, onion, and salt; stir
the meat round over the fire for a few
minutes until it produces a thin gravy,
then add the water, and let it simmer
gently from ½ to ¾ of an hour, skimming
off every particle of fat. When done,
strain it through a sieve, and put it by
in a cool place until required. The same,
if wanted quite plain, is done by merely
omitting the vegetables, salt, and clove;
the butter cannot be objectionable, as it
is taken out in skimming. <i>Time.</i>—½ to
¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> per pint. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
1 lb. of beef to make 1
pint of good beef-tea.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The meat left from beef-tea
may be boiled a little longer, and pounded
with spices, &amp;c., for potting. It makes
a very nice breakfast dish.</p>


<h3>BEETROOT, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Beetroot; boiling water.
<i>Mode.</i>—When large, young, and juicy,
this vegetable makes a very excellent
addition to winter salads, and may easily
be converted into an economical and
quickly-made pickle. (<i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#BEETROOT_Pickled">Beetroot,
Pickled</a></span>.) Beetroot is more frequently
served cold than hot: when the latter mode
is preferred, melted butter should be sent
to table with it. It may also be stewed
with button onions, or boiled and served
with roasted onions. Wash the beets
thoroughly; but do not prick or break
the skin before they are cooked, as they
would lose their beautiful colour in boiling.
Put them into boiling water, and
let them boil until tender, keeping them
well covered. If to be served hot, remove
the peel quickly, cut the beetroot into
thick slices, and send to table melted
butter. For salads, pickle, &amp;c., let the
root cool, then peel, and cut it into slices.
<i>Time.</i>—Small beetroot, 1½ to 2 hours;
large, 2½ to 3 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, in
full season, 2<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable.</i>—May
be had at any time.</p>


<h3><a id="BEETROOT_Pickled"></a>BEETROOT, Pickled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sufficient vinegar to cover
the beets, 2 oz. of whole pepper, 2 oz. of
allspice to each gallon of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
the beets free from dirt, and be
very careful not to prick the outside skin,
or they would lose their beautiful colour.
Put them into boiling water, let them
simmer gently, and when about three
parts done, which will be in 1½ hour,
take them out and let them cool. Boil
the vinegar with pepper and allspice, in
the above proportion, for 10 minutes,
and when cold, pour it on the beets,
which must be peeled and cut into slices
about ½ inch thick. Cover with bladder
to exclude the air, and in a week they
will be fit for use.</p>


<h3>BISCUITS, Crisp.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, the yolk of
1 egg, milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the flour and
the yolk of the egg with sufficient milk
to make the whole into a very stiff paste;
beat it well, and knead it until it is perfectly
smooth. Roll the paste out <i>very
thin</i>; with a round cutter shape it into
small biscuits, and bake them a nice
brown in a slow oven from 12 to 18
minutes. <i>Time.</i>—12 to 18 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BISCUITS, Dessert, which may be
flavoured with Ground Ginger,
Cinnamon, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ½ lb. of butter,
½ lb. of sifted sugar, the yolks of 6 eggs,
flavouring to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the butter
into a basin; warm it, but do not allow
it to oil; then with the hand beat it to
a cream. Add the flour by degrees,
then the sugar and flavouring, and
moisten the whole with the yolks of the
eggs, which should previously be well
beaten. When all the ingredients are
thoroughly incorporated, drop the mixture
from a spoon on to a buttered paper,
leaving a distance between each cake, for
they spread as soon as they begin to get
warm. Bake in rather a slow oven from
12 to 18 minutes, and do not let the
biscuits acquire too much colour. In
making the above quantity, half may be
flavoured with ground ginger and the
other half with essence of lemon or currants,
to make a variety. With whatever
the preparation is flavoured, so are the
biscuits called, and an endless variety
may be made in this manner. <i>Time.</i>—12
to 18 minutes, or rather longer, in a
very slow oven. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Sufficient</i> to make from 3 to 4 dozen
cakes. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BISCUITS, Simple Hard.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour
allow 2 oz. of butter, about ½ pint of
skimmed milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Warm the butter
in milk until the former is dissolved,
and then mix it with the flour into a very
stiff paste; beat it with a rolling-pin
until the dough looks perfectly smooth.
Roll it out thin; cut it with the top of a
glass into round biscuits; prick them
well, and bake them from 6 to 10 minutes.
The above is the proportion of milk
which we think would convert the flour
into a stiff paste; but should it be found
too much, an extra spoonful or two of
flour must be put in. These biscuits are
very nice for the cheese course. <i>Time.</i>—6
to 10 minutes. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<div class="caption">ROAST BLACK-COCK.</div>
</div>


<h3>BLACK-COCK, to Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Black-cock, butter, toast.
<i>Mode.</i>—Let these birds hang for a few
days, or they will be tough and tasteless,
if not well kept. Pluck and draw them,
and wipe the insides and outsides with a
damp cloth, as washing spoils the flavour.
Cut off the heads, and truss them,
the same as a roast fowl, cutting off the
toes, and scalding and peeling the feet.
Trussing them with the head on, as
shown in the engraving, is still practised
by many cooks, but the former method
is now considered the best. Put them
down to a brisk fire, well baste them
with butter, and serve with a piece of
toast under, and a good gravy and bread
sauce. After trussing, some cooks cover
the breast with vine-leaves and slices of
bacon, and then roast them. They
should be served in the same manner
and with the same accompaniments as
with the plainly-roasted birds. <i>Time.</i>—45
to 50 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, from
5<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> the brace; but seldom bought.
<i>Sufficient</i>,—2 or 3 for a dish. <i>Seasonable</i>
from the middle of August to the end of
December.</p>


<h3>BLACK-COCK, to Carve.</h3>

<div class="caption">BLACK-COCK.</div>
</div>

<p>Skilful carving of game undoubtedly
adds to the pleasure of the guests at a
dinner-table; for game seems pre-eminently
to be composed of such delicate
limbs and tender flesh that an inapt practitioner
appears to more disadvantage
when mauling these pretty and favourite
dishes, than larger and more robust
<i>pièces de résistance</i>. This bird is variously
served with or without the head on; and,
although we do not personally object to
the appearance of the head as shown in
the woodcut, yet it seems to be more
in vogue to
serve it without.
The
carving is not
difficult, but
should be elegantly
and deftly done. Slices from the
breast, cut in the direction of the dotted
line from 2 to 1, should be taken off, the
merrythought displaced, and the leg and
wing removed by running the knife along
from 3 to 4, reserving the thigh, which
is considered a great delicacy, for the
most honoured guests, some of whom may
also esteem the brains of this bird.</p>


<h3>BLANCMANGE (a Supper Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of new milk,
1¼ oz. of isinglass, the rind of ½ lemon,
¼ lb. of loaf sugar, 10 bitter almonds,
½ oz. of sweet almonds, 1 pint of cream.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk into a saucepan,
with the isinglass, lemon-rind, and sugar,
and let these ingredients stand by the
side of the fire until the milk is well flavoured;
add the almonds, which should
be blanched and pounded in a mortar
to a paste, and let the milk just boil
up; strain it through a fine sieve or
muslin into a jug, add the cream, and
stir the mixture occasionally until
nearly cold. Let it stand for a few
minutes, then pour it into the mould,
which should be previously oiled with
the purest salad-oil, or dipped in cold
water. There will be a sediment at the
bottom of the jug, which must not be
poured into the mould, as, when turned
out, it would very much disfigure the
appearance of the blancmange. This
blancmange may be made very much
richer by using 1½ pint of cream, and
melting the isinglass in ½ pint of boiling
water. The flavour may also be very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
varied by adding bay-leaves, laurel-leaves,
or essence of vanilla, instead of the lemon-rind
and almonds. Noyeau, Maraschino,
Curaçoa, or any favourite liqueur, added
in small proportions, very much enhances
the flavour of this always favourite dish.
In turning it out, just loosen the edges
of the blancmange from the mould, place
a dish on it, and turn it quickly over: it
should come out easily, and the blancmange
have a smooth glossy appearance
when the mould is oiled, which it frequently
has not when it is only dipped in
water. It may be garnished as fancy
dictates. <i>Time.</i>—About 1½ hour to steep
the lemon-rind and almonds in the milk.
<i>Average cost</i>, with cream at 1<i>s.</i> per pint,
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill a quart mould.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<h3>BLANCMANGE, Cheap.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of sugar, 1 quart of
milk, 1½ oz. of isinglass, the rind of ½
lemon, 4 laurel-leaves. <i>Mode.</i>—Put all
the ingredients into a lined saucepan,
and boil gently until the isinglass is dissolved;
taste it occasionally to ascertain
when it is sufficiently flavoured with the
laurel-leaves; then take them out, and
keep stirring the mixture over the fire
for about 10 minutes. Strain it through
a fine sieve into a jug, and, when nearly
cold, pour it into a well-oiled mould,
omitting the sediment at the bottom.
Turn it out carefully on a dish, and garnish
with preserves, bright jelly, or a
compôte of fruit. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill

<h3>BOUDIN à la REINE (an Entrée;
M. Ude’s Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold roast
fowls, 1 pint of Béchamel, salt and cayenne
to taste, egg and bread-crumbs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Take the breasts and nice white
meat from the fowls; cut it into small dice
of an equal size, and throw them into some
good Béchamel (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#BECHAMEL_or_French_White_Sauce">Béchamel</a></span>); season
with salt and cayenne, and put the mixture
into a dish to cool. When this preparation
is quite cold, cut it into 2 equal
parts, which should be made into boudins
of a long shape, the size of the dish they
are intended to be served on; roll them
in flour, egg and bread-crumb them, and
be careful that the ends are well covered
with the crumbs, otherwise they will
break in the frying-pan; fry them a nice
colour, put them before the fire to drain
the greasy moisture from them, and
serve with the remainder of the Béchamel
poured round: this should be
thinned with a little stock. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes to fry the boudins. <i>Average
cost</i>, exclusive of the fowl, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 1 entrée.</p>


<h3>BRAWN, to make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To a pig’s head weighing
6 lbs. allow 1½ lb. lean beef, 2 tablespoonfuls
of salt, 2 teaspoonfuls of pepper,
a little cayenne, 6 pounded cloves.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut off the cheeks and salt them,
unless the head be small, when all may
be used. After carefully cleaning the
head, put it on in sufficient cold water
to cover it, with the beef, and skim it
just before it boils. A head weighing
6 lbs. will require boiling from 2 to 3
hours. When sufficiently boiled to come
off the bones easily, put it into a hot pan,
remove the bones, and chop the meat
with a sharp knife before the fire, together
with the beef. <i>It is necessary to do
this as quickly as possible to prevent the
fat settling in it.</i> Sprinkle in the seasoning,
which should have been previously
mixed. Stir it well and put it
quickly into a brawn-tin if you have one;
if not, a cake-tin or mould will answer
the purpose, if the meat is well pressed
with weights, which must not be removed
for several hours. When quite cold, dip
the tin into boiling water for a minute or
two, and the preparation will turn out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and be fit for use. <i>Time.</i>—From 2 to 3
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, for a pig’s head,
4½<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The liquor in which the head
was boiled will make good pea soup, and
the fat, if skimmed off and boiled in
water, and afterwards poured into cold
water, answers the purpose of lard.</p>


<h3>BREAD-MAKING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Panification</span>, or bread-making, consists
of the following processes, in the
case of Wheaten Flour. Fifty or sixty
per cent. of water is added to the flour,
with the addition of some leavening matter,
and preferably, of yeast from malt
and hops. All kinds of leavening matter
have, however, been, and are still used
in different parts of the world: in the
East Indies, “toddy,” which is a liquor
that flows from the wounded cocoa-nut
tree; and in the West Indies, “dunder,”
or the refuse of the distillation of rum.
The dough then undergoes the well-known
process called <i>kneading</i>. The
yeast produces fermentation, a process
which may be thus described:—The
dough reacting upon the leavening matter
introduced, the starch of the flour is
transformed into saccharine matter, the
saccharine matter being afterwards
changed into alcohol and carbonic acid.
The dough must be well “bound,” and
yet allow the escape of the little bubbles
of carbonic acid which accompany the
fermentation, and which, in their passage,
cause the numerous little holes
which are seen in light bread.</p>

<p>The yeast must be good and fresh, if
the bread is to be digestible and nice.
Stale yeast produces, instead of vinous
fermentation, an acetous fermentation,
which flavours the bread and makes it
disagreeable. A poor thin yeast produces
an imperfect fermentation, the
result being a heavy, unwholesome loaf.</p>

<p>When the dough is well kneaded, it is
left to stand for some time, and then, as
soon as it begins to swell, it is divided
into loaves; after which it is again left
to stand, when it once more swells up,
and manifests for the last time the symptoms
of fermentation. It is then put into
the oven, where the water contained in
the dough is partly evaporated, and the
loaves swell up again, while a yellow
crust begins to form upon the surface.
When the bread is sufficiently baked, the
bottom crust is hard and resonant if
struck with the finger, while the crumb
is elastic, and rises again after being
pressed down with the finger. The bread
is, in all probability, baked sufficiently
if, on opening the door of the oven, you
are met by a cloud of steam, which
quickly passes away.</p>

<p>One word as to the unwholesomeness
of new bread and hot rolls. When bread
is taken out of the oven, it is full of
moisture; the starch is held together in
masses, and the bread, instead of being
crusted so as to expose each grain of
starch to the saliva, actually prevents
their digestion by being formed by the
teeth into leathery poreless masses, which
lie on the stomach like so many bullets.
Bread should always be at least a day
old before it is eaten; and, if properly
made, and kept in a <i>cool dry</i> place, ought
to be perfectly soft and palatable at the
end of three or four days. Hot rolls,
swimming in melted butter, and new
bread, ought to be carefully shunned by
everybody who has the slightest respect
for that much-injured individual—the
Stomach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aërated Bread.</span>—It is not unknown
to some of our readers that Dr. Dauglish,
of Malvern, has recently patented a process
for making bread “light,” without
the use of leaven. The ordinary process
of bread-making by fermentation is tedious,
and much labour of human hands
is requisite in the kneading, in order that
the dough may be thoroughly interpenetrated
with the leaven. The new process
impregnates the bread, by the application
of machinery, with carbonic acid gas, or
fixed air. Different opinions are expressed
about the bread; but it is curious
to note, that, as corn is now reaped by
machinery, and dough is baked by machinery,
the whole process of bread-making
is probably in course of undergoing
changes which will emancipate
both the housewife and the professional
baker from a large amount of labour.</p>

<p>In the production of Aërated Bread,
wheaten flour, water, salt, and carbonic
acid gas (generated by proper machinery),
are the only materials employed. We
need not inform our readers that carbonic
acid gas is the source of the effervescence,
whether in common water
coming from a depth, or in lemonade, or
any aërated drink. Its action, in the
new bread, takes the place of fermentation
in the old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>In the patent process, the dough is
mixed in a great iron ball, inside which
is a system of paddles, perpetually turning,
and doing the kneading part of the
business. Into this globe the flour is
dropped till it is full, and then the common
atmospheric air is pumped out, and
the pure gas turned on. The gas is followed
by the water, which has been
aërated for the purpose, and then begins
the churning or kneading part of the
business.</p>

<p>Of course, it is not long before we have
the dough, and very “light” and nice it
looks. This is caught in tins, and passed
on to the floor of the oven, which is an
endless floor, moving slowly through the
fire. Done to a turn, the loaves emerge
at the other end of the apartment,—and
the Aërated Bread is made.</p>

<p>It may be added, that it is a good plan
to change one’s baker from time to time,
and so secure a change in the quality of
the bread that is eaten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mixed Breads.</span>—Rye bread is hard of
digestion, and requires longer and slower
baking than wheaten bread. It is better
when made with leaven of wheaten flour
rather than yeast, and turns out lighter.
It should not be eaten till two days old.
It will keep a long time.</p>

<p>A good bread may be made by mixing
rye-flour, wheat-flour, and rice-paste, in
equal proportions; also by mixing rye,
wheat, and barley. In Norway, it is said
that they only bake their barley bread
once a year, such is its “keeping”
quality.</p>

<p>Indian-corn flour mixed with wheat-flour
(half with half) makes a nice bread,
but it is not considered very digestible,
though it keeps well.</p>

<p>Rice cannot be made into bread, nor
can potatoes; but one-third potato-flour
to three-fourths wheaten flour makes a
tolerably good loaf.</p>

<p>A very good bread, better than the
ordinary sort, and of a delicious flavour,
is said to be produced by adopting the
following recipe:—Take ten parts of
wheat-flour, five parts of potato-flour,
one part of rice-paste; knead together,
add the yeast, and bake as usual. This
is, of course, cheaper than wheaten
bread.</p>

<p>Flour, when freshly ground, is too glutinous
to make good bread, and should
therefore not be used immediately, but
should be kept dry for a few weeks, and
stirred occasionally until it becomes
dry, and crumbles easily between the
fingers.</p>

<p>Flour should be perfectly dry before
being used for bread or cakes; if at all
damp, the preparation is sure to be
heavy. Before mixing it with the other
ingredients, it is a good plan to place it
for an hour or two before the fire, until
it feels warm and dry.</p>

<p>Yeast from home-brewed beer is generally
preferred to any other: it is very
bitter, and on that account should be
well washed, and put away until the
thick mass settles. If it still continues
bitter, the process should be repeated;
and, before being used, all the water
floating at the top must be poured off.
German yeast is now very much used,
and should be moistened, and thoroughly
mixed with the milk or water with which
the bread is to be made.</p>

<p>The following observations are extracted
from a valuable work on Bread-making,
and will be found very useful
to our readers:—</p>

<p>The first thing required for making
wholesome bread is the utmost cleanliness;
the next is the soundness and
sweetness of all the ingredients used for
it; and, in addition to these, there
must be attention and care through the
whole process.</p>

<p>An almost certain way of spoiling
dough is to leave it half-made, and to
allow it to become cold before it is
finished. The other most common
causes of failure are using yeast which is
no longer sweet, or which has been
frozen, or has had hot liquid poured over
it.</p>

<p>Too small a proportion of yeast, or insufficient
time allowed for the dough to
rise, will cause the bread to be heavy.</p>

<p>Heavy bread will also most likely be
the result of making the dough very
hard, and letting it become quite cold,
particularly in winter.</p>

<div class="caption">COTTAGE LOAF.</div>
</div>

<p>If either the sponge or the dough be
permitted to overwork itself, that is to
say, if the mixing and kneading be neglected
when it has reached the proper
point for either, sour bread will probably
be the consequence in warm weather,
and bad bread in any. The goodness
will also be endangered by placing it so
near the fire as to make any part of it
hot, instead of maintaining the gentle
and equal degree of heat required for its
due fermentation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Milk or Butter.</span>—Milk which is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
perfectly sweet will not only injure the
flavour of the bread, but, in sultry
weather, will often cause it to be quite
uneatable; yet either of them, if <i>fresh
and good</i>, will materially improve its
quality.</p>

<p>To keep bread sweet and fresh, as
soon as it is cold it should be put into a
clean earthen pan, with a cover to it:
this pan should be placed at a little distance
from the ground, to allow a current
of air to pass underneath. Some
persons prefer keeping bread on clean
wooden shelves without being covered,
that the crust may not soften. Stale
bread may be freshened by warming it
through in a gentle oven. Stale pastry,
cakes, &amp;c., may also be improved by this
method.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 290px;">
<img src="images/illus-047a.jpg" width="290" height="140" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">COTTAGE LOAF.</div>
</div>

<p>The utensils required for making
bread on a moderate scale, are a kneading-trough
or pan, sufficiently large
that the dough may be kneaded freely
without throwing the flour over the
edges, and also to allow for its rising; a
hair sieve for straining yeast, and one or
two strong spoons.</p>

<p>Yeast must always be good of its kind,
and in a fitting state to produce ready
and proper fermentation. Yeast of
strong beer or ale produces more effect
than that of milder kinds; and the
fresher the yeast, the smaller the quantity
will be required to raise the dough.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the oven for baking
bread should be rather quick, and the
heat so regulated as to penetrate the
dough without hardening the outside.
The oven door should not be opened after
the bread is put in until the dough is
set, or has become firm, as the cool air
admitted, will have an unfavourable
effect on it.</p>

<p>Brick ovens are generally considered
the best adapted for baking bread: these
should be heated with wood faggots, and
then swept and mopped out, to cleanse
them for the reception of the bread.
Iron ovens are more difficult to manage,
being apt to burn the surface of the
bread before the middle is baked. To
remedy this, a few clean bricks should
be set at the bottom of the oven, close
together, to receive the tins of bread.
In many modern stoves the ovens are so
much improved that they bake admirably;
and they can always be brought
to the required temperature, when it is
higher than is needed, by leaving the
door open for a time.</p>

</div>


<h3>BREAD, to make good Home-made
(Miss Acton’s Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 quartern of flour, 1
large tablespoonful of solid brewer’s
yeast, or nearly 1 oz. of fresh German
yeast, 1¼ to 1½ pint of warm milk-and-water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the flour into a large
earthenware bowl or deep pan; then,
with a strong metal or wooden spoon,
hollow out the middle; but do not clear
it entirely away from the bottom of the
pan, as, in that case, the sponge, or
leaven (as it was formerly termed) would
stick to it, which it ought not to do.
Next take either a large tablespoonful
of brewer’s yeast which has been rendered
solid by mixing it with plenty of
cold water, and letting it afterwards
stand to settle for a day and night; or
nearly an ounce of German yeast; put it
into a large basin, and proceed to mix it,
so that it shall be as smooth as cream,
with ¾ pint of warm milk-and-water, or
with water only; though even a very
little milk will much improve the bread.
Pour the yeast into the hole made in the
flour, and stir into it as much of that
which lies round it as will make a thick
batter, in which there must be no lumps.
Strew plenty of flour on the top, throw a
thick clean cloth over, and set it where
the air is warm; but do not place it upon
the kitchen fender, for it will become
too much heated there. Look at it from
time to time: when it has been laid for
nearly an hour, and when the yeast has
risen and broken through the flour, so
that bubbles appear in it, you will know
that it is ready to be made up into
dough. Then place the pan on a strong
chair, or dresser, or table, of convenient
height; pour into the sponge the remainder
of the warm milk-and-water;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
stir into it as much of the flour as you
can with the spoon; then wipe it out
clean with your fingers, and lay it aside.
Next take plenty of the remaining flour,
throw it on the top of the leaven, and begin,
with the knuckles of both hands, to knead
it well. When the flour is nearly all
kneaded in, begin to draw the edges of
the dough towards the middle, in order
to mix the whole thoroughly; and when
it is free from flour and lumps and
crumbs, and does not stick to the hands
when touched, it will be done, and may
be covered with the cloth, and left to
rise a second time. In ¾ hour look at it,
and should it have swollen very much
and begin to crack, it will be light
enough to bake. Turn it then on to a
paste-board or very clean dresser, and
with a large sharp knife divide it in two;
make it up quickly into loaves, and
despatch it to the oven: make one
or two incisions across the tops of the
loaves, as they will rise more easily if
this be done. If baked in tins or pans,
rub them with a tiny piece of butter
laid on a piece of clean paper, to prevent
the dough from sticking to them. All
bread should be turned upside down, or
on its side, as soon as it is drawn from
the oven: if this be neglected, the under
part of the loaves will become wet and
blistered from the steam, which cannot
then escape from them. <i>To make the dough
without setting a sponge</i>, merely mix the
yeast with the greater part of the warm
milk-and-water, and wet up the whole
of the flour at once after a little salt has
been stirred in, proceeding exactly, in
every other respect, as in the directions
just given. As the dough will <i>soften</i> in
the rising, it should be made quite firm
at first, or it will be too lithe by the time
it is ready for the oven. <i>Time.</i>—To be
left to rise an hour the first time, ¾ hour
the second time; to be baked from 1 to
1¼ hour, or baked in one loaf from 1½ to
2 hours.</p>


<h3>BREAD, to make a Peck of good.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 lbs. of potatoes, 6 pints
of cold water, ½ pint of good yeast, a
peck of flour, 2 oz. of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel
and boil the potatoes; beat them to a
cream while warm; then add 1 pint of
cold water, strain through a colander,
and add to it ½ pint of good yeast, which
should have been put in water over-night
to take off its bitterness. Stir all well
together with a wooden spoon, and pour
the mixture into the centre of the flour;
mix it to the substance of cream, cover
it over closely, and let it remain near the
fire for an hour; then add the 5 pints of
water, milk-warm, with 2 oz. of salt;
pour this in, and mix the whole to a nice
light dough. Let it remain for about 2
hours; then make it into 7 loaves, and
bake for about 1½ hour in a good oven.
When baked, the bread should weigh
nearly 20 lbs. <i>Time.</i>—About 1½ hour.</p>


<h3>BREAD-AND-BUTTER
FRITTERS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Batter, 8 slices of bread
and butter, 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of jam.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make a batter, the same as for
apple fritters; cut some slices of bread
and butter, not very thick; spread half
of them with any jam that may be preferred,
and cover with the other slices;
slightly press them together, and cut
them out in square, long, or round
pieces. Dip them in the batter, and fry
in boiling lard for about 10 minutes;
drain them before the fire on a piece of
blotting-paper or cloth. Dish them,
sprinkle over sifted sugar, and serve.
<i>Time.</i>—About 10 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>BREAD-AND-BUTTER PUDDING,
Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—9 thin slices of bread and
butter, 1½ pint of milk, 4 eggs, sugar to
taste, ¼ lb. of currants, flavouring of vanilla,
grated lemon-peel, or nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
9 slices of bread and butter, not very
thick, and put them into a pie-dish, with
currants between each layer, and on the
top. Sweeten and flavour the milk, either
by infusing a little lemon-peel in it, or by
adding a few drops of essence of vanilla;
well whisk the eggs, and stir these to the
milk. <i>Strain</i> this over the bread and
butter, and bake in a moderate oven for
1 hour, or rather longer. This pudding
may be very much enriched by adding
cream, candied peel, or more eggs than
stated above. It should not be turned
out, but sent to table in the pie-dish, and
is better for being made about two hours
before it is baked. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour, or
rather longer. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>


<h3>BREAD CRUMBS, Fried.</h3>

<p>Cut the bread into thin slices, place
them in a cool oven over-night, and when
thoroughly dry and crisp, roll them
down into fine crumbs. Put some lard,
or clarified dripping, into a frying-pan;
bring it to the boiling-point, throw in
the crumbs, and fry them very quickly.
Directly they are done, lift them out
with a slice, and drain them before the
fire from all greasy moisture. When
quite crisp, they are ready for use. The
fat they are fried in should be clear, and
the crumbs should not have the slightest
appearance or taste of having been, in
the least degree, burnt.</p>


<h3>BREAD, Fried, for Borders.</h3>

<p>Proceed by frying some slices of bread,
cut in any fanciful shape, in boiling lard.
When quite crisp, dip one side of the
sippet into the beaten white of an egg
mixed with a little flour, and place it on
the edge of the dish. Continue in this
manner till the border is completed, arranging
the sippets a pale and a dark one
alternately.</p>


<h3>BREAD, Fried Sippets of, for Garnishing
many Dishes.</h3>

<p>Cut the bread into thin slices, and
stamp them out in whatever shape you
like,—rings, crosses, diamonds, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Fry them in the same manner as the
bread-crumbs, in clear boiling lard or
clarified dripping, and drain them until
thoroughly crisp before the fire. When
variety is desired, fry some of a pale
colour, and others of a darker hue.</p>


<h3>BREAKFASTS.</h3>

<p>It will not be necessary to give here a
long bill of fare of cold joints, &amp;c., which
may be placed on the sideboard, and do
duty at the breakfast-table. Suffice it
to say, that any cold meat the larder
may furnish should be nicely garnished
and be placed on the buffet. Collared
and potted meats or fish, cold game or
poultry, veal-and-ham pies, game-and-rump-steak
pies, are all suitable dishes
for the breakfast-table; as also cold ham,
tongue, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following list of hot dishes may
perhaps assist our readers in knowing
what to provide for the comfortable meal
called breakfast. Broiled fish, such as
mackerel, whiting, herrings, dried haddocks,
&amp;c.; mutton chops and rump-steaks,
broiled sheep’s kidneys, kidneys
à la maître d’hôtel, sausages, plain rashers
of bacon, bacon and poached eggs, ham
and poached eggs, omelets, plain boiled
eggs, œufs-au-plat, poached eggs on
toast, muffins, toast, marmalade, butter,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the summer, and when they are
obtainable, always have a vase of freshly-gathered
flowers on the breakfast-table,
and, when convenient, a nicely-arranged
dish of fruit: when strawberries are in
season, these are particularly refreshing;
as also grapes, or even currants.</p>


<h3>BRILL.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of salt to each gallon
of water; a little vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Clean
the brill, cut off the fins, and rub
it over with a little lemon-juice, to preserve
its whiteness. Set the fish in sufficient
cold water to cover it; throw in salt, in
the above proportions, and a little vinegar,
and bring it gradually to boil: simmer
very gently, till the fish is done, which
will be in about 10 minutes for a small
brill, reckoning from the time the water
begins to simmer. It is difficult to give
the <i>exact</i> number of minutes required for
cooking a brill, as the fish varies somewhat
in thickness, but the cook can always
bear in mind that fish of every description
should be <i>very thoroughly dressed</i>,
and never come to table in the <i>least degree
underdone</i>. The time for boiling of course
depends entirely on the size of the fish.
Serve it on a hot napkin, and garnish with
cut lemon, parsley, horseradish, and a
little lobster coral sprinkled over the
fish. Send lobster or shrimp sauce and
plain melted butter to table with it.
<i>Time.</i>—After the water boils, a small
brill, 10 minutes; a medium sized brill,
15 to 20 minutes; a large brill, ½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 4<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i>; but when
the market is plentifully supplied, may
be had from 2<i>s.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to April.</p>

<p><i>To choose Brill.</i>—The flesh of this fish,
like that of turbot, should be of a yellowish
tint, and should be chosen on account
of its thickness. If the flesh has a
bluish tint, it is not good.</p>

<p>A Brill and John Dory are carved in
the same manner as a Turbot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The thick parts of the middle
of the back are the best slices in a turbot;
and the rich gelatinous skin covering
the fish, as well as a little of the
thick part of the fins, are dainty morsels,
and should be placed on each plate.</p>

</div>


<h3>BROWNING, for Stock.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 oz. of powdered sugar,
and ½ a pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Place the
sugar in a stewpan over a slow fire until
it begins to melt, keeping it stirred with
a wooden spoon until it becomes black,
when add the water, and let it dissolve.
Cork closely, and use a few drops when
required.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—In France, burnt onions are
made use of for the purpose of browning.
As a general rule, the process of browning
is to be discouraged, as apt to impart
a slightly unpleasant flavour to the stock,
and consequently all soups made from it.</p>


<h3>BROWNING for Gravies and
Sauces.</h3>

<p>The browning for stock answers equally
well for sauces and gravies, when it is
absolutely necessary to colour them in
this manner; but where they can be made
to look brown by using ketchup, wine,
browned flour, tomatoes, or any coloured
sauce, it is far preferable. As, however,
in cooking so much depends on appearance,
perhaps it would be as well for the
inexperienced cook to use the artificial
means. When no browning is at hand,
and you wish to heighten the colour of
your gravy, dissolve a lump of sugar in an
iron spoon close to a sharp fire; when it
is in a liquid state, drop it into the sauce
or gravy quite hot. Care, however,
must be taken not to put in too much,
as it would impart a very disagreeable
flavour to the preparation.</p>


<h3>BRUSSELS-SPROUTS, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each ½ gallon of water
allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; a
<i>very small</i> piece of soda. <i>Mode.</i>—Clean
the sprouts from insects, nicely wash
them, and pick off any dead or discoloured
leaves from the outsides; put them into
a saucepan of <i>boiling</i> water, with salt
and soda in the above proportion; keep
the pan uncovered, and let them boil
quickly over a brisk fire until tender;
drain, dish, and serve with a tureen of
melted butter, or with a maître d’hôtel
sauce poured over them. Another mode
of serving them is, when they are dished,
to stir in about 1½ oz. of butter and a
seasoning of pepper and salt. They
must, however, be sent to table very
quickly, as, being so very small, this
vegetable soon cools. Where the cook
is very expeditious, this vegetable when
cooked may be arranged on the dish in
the form of a pineapple, and so served
has a very pretty appearance. <i>Time.</i>—from
9 to 12 minutes after the water
boils. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per peck.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow between 40 and 50 for
5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from November
to March.</p>


<h3>BUBBLE-AND-SQUEAK.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—A
few thin slices of cold boiled beef;
butter, cabbage, 1 sliced onion, pepper
and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Fry
the slices of beef gently in a little butter,
taking care not to dry them up.
Lay them on a flat dish, and cover with
fried greens. The greens may be prepared
from cabbage sprouts or green
savoys. They should be boiled till
tender, well drained, minced, and placed,
till quite hot, in a frying-pan, with
butter, a sliced onion, and seasoning of
pepper and salt. When the onion is
done, it is ready to serve. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the cold beef, 3<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>BULLOCK’S HEART, to Dress a.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 heart, stuffing of veal
forcemeat. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the heart into
warm water to soak for 2 hours; then
wipe it well with a cloth, and, after
cutting off the lobes, stuff the inside with
a highly-seasoned forcemeat. Fasten it
in, by means of a needle and coarse
thread; tie the heart up in paper, and
set it before a good fire, being very particular
to keep it well basted, or it will
eat dry, there being very little of its own
fat. Two or three minutes before dishing
remove the paper, baste well, and serve
with good gravy and red-currant jelly or
melted butter. If the heart is very large,
it will require 2 hours, and, covered with
a caul, may be baked as well as roasted.
<i>Time.</i>—Large heart, 2 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 8 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This is an excellent family dish,
is very savoury, and, though not seen at
many good tables, may be recommended
for its cheapness and economy.</p>


<h3>BUNS, Light.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ teaspoonful of tartaric
acid, ½ teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda,
1 lb. of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of loaf
sugar, ¼ lb. of currants or raisins,—when
liked, a few caraway seeds, ½ pint of cold
new milk, 1 egg. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub the tartaric
acid, soda, and flour all together
through a hair sieve; work the butter
into the flour; add the sugar, currants,
and caraway seeds, when the flavour of
the latter is liked. Mix all these ingredients
well together; make a hole in the
middle of the flour, and pour in the milk,
mixed with the egg, which should be
well beaten; mix quickly, and set the
dough, with a fork, on baking-tins, and
bake the buns for about 20 minutes.
This mixture makes a very good cake,
and if put into a tin, should be baked 1½
hour. The same quantity of flour, soda,
and tartaric acid, with ½ pint of milk and
a little salt, will make either bread or
tea-cakes, if wanted quickly. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes for the buns; if made into a cake,
1½ hour. <i>Sufficient</i> to make about 12
buns.</p>

<h3>BUNS, Plain.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of good
butter, ¼ lb. of sugar, 1 egg, nearly ¼ pint
of milk, 2 small teaspoonfuls of baking-powder,
a few drops of essence of lemon.
<i>Mode.</i>—Warm the butter, without oiling
it; beat it with a wooden spoon; stir the
flour in gradually with the sugar, and
mix these ingredients well together. Make
the milk lukewarm, beat up with it the
yolk of the egg and the essence of lemon,
and stir these to the flour, &amp;c. Add the
baking-powder, beat the dough well for
about 10 minutes, divide it into 24 pieces,
put them into buttered tins or cups, and
bake in a brisk oven from 20 to 30 minutes.
<i>Time.</i>—20 to 30 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to make 12 buns.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BUNS, Victoria.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 oz. of pounded loaf
sugar, 1 egg, 1½ oz. of ground rice, 2 oz.
of butter, 1½ oz. of currants, a few thin
slices of candied-peel, flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Whisk
the egg, stir in the sugar, and
beat these ingredients both together;
beat the butter to a cream, stir in the
ground rice, currants, and candied-peel,
and as much flour as will make it of such
a consistency that it may be rolled into
7 or 8 balls. Place these on a buttered
tin, and bake them for ½ to ¾ hour. They
should be put into the oven immediately
or they will become heavy, and the oven
should be tolerably brisk. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to
make 7 or 8 buns. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>BUTTER, Browned.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of butter, 1 tablespoonful
of minced parsley, 3 tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, salt and pepper to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the butter into a
frying pan over a nice clear fire, and when
it smokes, throw in the parsley, and add
the vinegar and seasoning. Let the
whole simmer for a minute or two, when
it is ready to serve. This is a very good
sauce for skate. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour.</p>


<h3>BUTTER, Clarified.</h3>

<p>Put the butter in a basin before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
fire, and when it melts, stir it round once
or twice, and let it settle. Do not strain
it unless absolutely necessary, as it
causes so much waste. Pour it gently
off into a clean dry jar, carefully leaving
all sediment behind. Let it cool, and
carefully exclude the air by means of a
bladder, or piece of wash-leather, tied
over. If the butter is salt, it may be
washed before melting, when it is to be
used for sweet dishes.</p>


<h3>BUTTER, Curled.</h3>

<p>Tie a strong cloth by two of the corners
to an iron hook in the wall; make a knot
with the other two ends, so that a stick
might pass through. Put the butter
into the cloth; twist it tightly over a
dish, into which the butter will fall
through the knot, so forming small and
pretty little strings. The butter may
then be garnished with parsley, if to
serve with a cheese course; or it may be
sent to table plain for breakfast, in an
ornamental dish. Squirted butter for
garnishing hams, salads, eggs, &amp;c., is
made by forming a piece of stiff paper
in the shape of a cornet, and squeezing
the butter in fine strings from the hole
at the bottom. Scooped butter is made
by dipping a teaspoon or scooper in warm
water, and then scooping the butter
quickly and thin. In warm weather, it
would not be necessary to heat the spoon.</p>


<h3>BUTTER, Fairy.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The yolks of 2 hard-boiled
eggs, 1 tablespoonful of orange-flower
water, 2 tablespoonfuls of pounded
sugar, ¼ lb. of good fresh butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat
the yolks of the eggs smoothly in
a mortar, with the orange-flower water
and the sugar, until the whole is reduced
to a fine paste; add the butter, and force
all through an old but clean cloth by
wringing the cloth and squeezing the
butter very hard. The butter will then
drop on the plate in large and small
pieces, according to the holes in the
cloth. Plain butter may be done in the
same manner, and is very quickly prepared,
besides having a very good effect.</p>


<h3>BUTTER, to keep Fresh.</h3>

<p>Butter may be kept fresh for ten or
twelve days by a very simple process.
Knead it well in cold water till the buttermilk
is extracted; then put it in a glazed
jar, which invert in another, putting
into the latter a sufficient quantity of
water to exclude the air. Renew the
water every day.</p>


<h3>BUTTER, Maître d’Hôtel, for
putting into Broiled Fish just
before it is sent to Table.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of butter, 2 dessertspoonfuls
of minced parsley, salt and
pepper to taste, the juice of 1 large
lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Work the above ingredients
well together, and let them be
thoroughly mixed with a wooden spoon.
If this is used as a sauce, it may be
poured either under or over the meat or
fish it is intended to be served with.
<i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity, 5<i>d.</i></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—4 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel,
2 do. of white stock, with 2 oz. of the
above maître d’hôtel butter stirred into
it, and just allowed to simmer for 1
minute, will be found an excellent hot
maître d’hôtel sauce.</p>


<h3>BUTTER, Melted.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of butter, a dessertspoonful
of flour, 1 wineglassful of water,
salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the butter up
into small pieces, put it into a saucepan,
dredge over the flour, and add the water
and a seasoning of salt; stir it <i>one way</i>
constantly till the whole of the ingredients
are melted and thoroughly blended.
Let it just boil, when it is ready to serve.
If the butter is to be melted with cream,
use the same quantity as of water, but
omit the flour; keep stirring it, but do
not allow it to boil. <i>Time.</i>—1 minute to
simmer. <i>Average cost</i> for this quantity,
4<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>BUTTER, Melted (more Economical).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful
of flour, salt to taste, ½ pint of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the flour and water
to a smooth batter, which put into a
saucepan. Add the butter and a seasoning
of salt, keep stirring <i>one way</i> till all
the ingredients are melted and perfectly
smooth; let the whole boil for a minute
or two, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—2 minutes
to simmer. <i>Average cost</i> for this quantity,
2<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>BUTTER, Rancid, What to do with.</h3>

<p>When butter has become very rancid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
it should be melted several times by a
moderate heat, with or without the addition
of water, and as soon as it has been
well kneaded, after the cooling, in order
to extract any water it may have retained,
it should be put into brown freestone
pots, sheltered from the contact of the
air. The French often add to it, after it
has been melted, a piece of toasted bread,
which helps to destroy the tendency of
the butter to rancidity.</p>


<h3>BUTTER, Melted (the French
Sauce Blanche).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of fresh butter, 1
tablespoonful of flour, salt to taste, ½ gill
of water, ½ spoonful of white vinegar, a very
little grated nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the
flour and water to a smooth batter, carefully
rubbing down with the back of a
spoon any lumps that may appear. Put
it in a saucepan with all the other ingredients,
and let it thicken on the fire,
but do not allow it to boil, lest it should
taste of the flour. <i>Time.</i>—1 minute to
simmer. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> for this quantity.</p>


<h3>BUTTER, Melted, made with Milk.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 teaspoonful of flour,
2 oz. of butter, ½ pint of milk, a few
grains of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the butter
and flour smoothly together on a plate,
put it into a lined saucepan, and pour in
the milk. Keep stirring it <i>one way</i> over
a sharp fire; let it boil quickly for a
minute or two, and it is ready to serve.
This is a very good foundation for onion,
lobster, or oyster sauce: using milk
instead of water makes it look much
whiter and more delicate. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
10 minutes. <i>Average cost</i> for this
quantity, 3<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>CABBAGE, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—-To each ½ gallon of water
allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt;
a <i>very small</i> piece of soda. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick
off all the dead outside leaves, cut
off as much of the stalk as possible, and
cut the cabbages across twice, at the
stalk end; if they should be very large,
quarter them. Wash them well in cold
water, place them in a colander, and
drain; then put them into <i>plenty</i> of <i>fast-boiling</i>
water, to which have been added
salt and soda in the above proportions.
Stir them down once or twice in the
water, keep the pan uncovered, and let
them boil quickly until tender. The
instant they are done, take them up into
a colander, place a plate over them, let
them thoroughly drain, dish, and serve.
<i>Time.</i>—Large cabbages, or savoys, ½ to ¾
hour, young summer cabbage, 10 to 12
minutes, after the water boils. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>d.</i> each in full season. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2
large ones for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Cabbages
and sprouts of various
kinds at any time.</p>


<h3>CABBAGE, Red, Pickled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Red cabbages, salt and
water; to each quart of vinegar, ½ oz. of
ginger well bruised, 1 oz. of whole black
pepper, and, when liked, a little cayenne.
<i>Mode.</i>—Take off the outside decayed
leaves of a nice red cabbage, cut it in
quarters, remove the stalks, and cut it
across in very thin slices. Lay these on
a dish, and strew them plentifully with
salt, covering them with another dish.
Let them remain for 24 hours, turn into
a colander to drain, and, if necessary,
wipe lightly with a clean soft cloth. Put
them in a jar; boil up the vinegar with
spices in the above proportion, and,
when cold, pour it over the cabbage. It
will be fit for use in a week or two, and,
if kept for a very long time, the cabbage
is liable to get soft and to discolour. To
be really nice and crisp, and of a good
red colour, it should be eaten almost immediately
after it is made. A little
bruised cochineal boiled with the vinegar
adds much to the appearance of this
pickle. Tie down with bladder, and
keep in a dry place. <i>Seasonable</i> in July
and August, but the pickle will be much
more crisp if the frost has just touched
the leaves.</p>


<h3>CABBAGE, Red, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 red cabbage, a small
slice of ham, ½ oz. of fresh butter, 1 pint
of weak stock or broth, 1 gill of vinegar,
salt and pepper to taste, 1 tablespoonful
of pounded sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the cabbage
into very thin slices, put it into a
stewpan, with the ham cut in dice, the
butter, ½ pint of stock, and the vinegar;
cover the pan closely, and let it stew for
1 hour. When it is very tender, add the
remainder of the stock, a seasoning of
salt and pepper, and the pounded sugar;
mix all well together, stir over the fire
until nearly all the liquor is dried away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and serve. Fried sausages are usually
sent to table with this dish: they should
be laid round and on the cabbage, as a
garnish. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more than 1
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to January.</p>


<h3>CABBAGE SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 large cabbage, 3 carrots,
2 onions, 4 or 5 slices of lean bacon,
salt and pepper to taste, 2 quarts of
medium stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Scald the cabbage,
cut it up and drain it. Line the
stewpan with the bacon, put in the
cabbage, carrots, and onions; moisten
with skimmings from the stock, and simmer
very gently, till the cabbage is
tender; add the stock, stew softly for
half an hour, and carefully skim off every
particle of fat. Season and serve. <i>Time.</i>—1½
hour.  <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per quart.
<i>Seasonable</i> in winter.  <i>Sufficient</i> for 8
persons.</p>


<h3>CABINET or CHANCELLOR’S
PUDDING.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ oz. of candied peel,
4 oz. of currants, 4 dozen sultanas, a few
slices of Savoy cake, sponge-cake, a
French roll, 4 eggs, 1 pint of milk,
grated lemon-rind, ¼ nutmeg, 3 tablespoonfuls
of sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Melt some
butter to a paste, and with it, well
grease the mould or basin in which the
pudding is to be boiled, taking care that
it is buttered in every part. Cut the
peel into thin slices, and place these in a
fanciful device at the bottom of the
mould, and fill in the spaces between
with currants and
sultanas; then add
a few slices of
sponge-cake or
French roll; drop
a few drops of
melted butter on
these,and between
each layer sprinkle a few currants. Proceed
in this manner until the mould is
nearly full; then flavour the milk with
nutmeg and grated lemon-rind; add the
sugar, and stir to this the eggs, which
should be well beaten. Beat this mixture
for a few minutes; then strain it
into the mould, which should be quite
full; tie a piece of buttered paper over
it, and let it stand for two hours; then
tie it down with a cloth, put it into
boiling water, and let it boil slowly for
1 hour. In taking it up, let it stand for
a minute or two before the cloth is removed;
then quickly turn it out of the
mould or basin, and serve with sweet
sauce separately. The flavouring of this
pudding may be varied by substituting
for the lemon-rind essence of vanilla or
bitter almonds; and it may be made
much richer by using cream; but this
is not at all necessary. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour,
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<h3>CABINET or BOILED BREAD-AND-BUTTER
PUDDING,
Plain.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 oz. of raisins, a few
thin slices of bread and butter, 3 eggs,
1 pint of milk, sugar to taste, ¼ nutmeg.
<i>Mode.</i>—Butter a pudding-basin and line
the inside with a layer of raisins that
have been previously stoned; then nearly
fill the basin with slices of bread and
butter with the crust cut off, and, in
another basin, beat the eggs; add to
them the milk, sugar, and grated nutmeg;
mix all well together, and pour the
whole on to the bread and butter; let it
stand ½ hour, then tie a floured cloth
over it; boil for 1 hour, and serve with
sweet sauce. Care must be taken that
the basin is quite full before the cloth is
tied over. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>CAFÉ AU LAIT.</h3>

<p>This is merely very strong coffee added
to a large proportion of good hot milk;
about 6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee
being quite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful
of milk. Of the essence which
answers admirably for <i>café au lait</i>, so
much would not be required. This preparation
is infinitely superior to the
weak watery coffee so often served at
English tables. A little cream mixed
with the milk, if the latter cannot be
depended on for richness, improves the
taste of the coffee, as also the richness of
the beverage. <i>Sufficient.</i>—6 tablespoonfuls
of strong coffee, or 2 tablespoonfuls of
the essence, to a breakfast-cupful of milk.</p>


<h3>CAFÉ NOIR.</h3>

<p>This is usually handed round after
dinner, and should be drunk well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
sweetened, with the addition of a little
brandy or liqueurs, which may be added
or not at pleasure. The coffee should be
made very strong, and served in very
small cups, but never mixed with milk
or cream. <i>Café noir</i> may be made of the
essence of coffee by pouring a tablespoonful
into each cup, and filling it up
with boiling water. This is a very
simple and expeditious manner of preparing
coffee for a large party, but the
essence for it must be made very good,
and kept well corked until required for use.</p>


<h3>CAKES, Making and Baking of.</h3>

<p><i>Eggs</i> should always be broken into a
cup, the whites and yolks separated, and
they should always be strained. Breaking
the eggs thus, the bad ones may
be easily rejected without spoiling the
others, and so cause no waste. As eggs
are used instead of yeast, they should be
very thoroughly whisked; they are generally
sufficiently beaten when thick
enough to carry the drop that falls from
the whisk.</p>

<p><i>Loaf Sugar</i> should be well pounded,
and then sifted through a fine sieve.</p>

<p><i>Currants</i> should be nicely washed,
picked, dried in a cloth, and then carefully
examined, that no pieces of grit
or stone may be left amongst them. They
should then be laid on a dish before the
fire, to become thoroughly dry; as, if
added damp to the other ingredients,
cakes will be liable to be heavy.</p>

<p><i>Good Butter</i> should always be used in
the manufacture of cakes; and, if beaten
to a cream, it saves much time and labour
to warm, but not melt, it before
beating.</p>

<p>Less butter and eggs are required for
cakes when yeast is mixed with the other
ingredients.</p>

<p>The heat of the oven is of great importance,
especially for large cakes. If the
heat be not tolerably fierce, the batter
will not rise. If the oven is too quick,
and there is any danger of the cake
burning or catching, put a sheet of clean
paper over the top: newspaper, or paper
that has been printed on, should never
be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>To know when a cake is sufficiently
baked, plunge a clean knife into the
middle of it; draw it quickly out, and if
it looks in the least sticky put the cake
back, and close the oven door until the
cake is done.</p>

<p>Cakes should be kept in closed tin
canisters or jars, and in a dry place.
Those made with yeast do not keep so
long as those made without it.</p>


<h3>CAKES, nice Breakfast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ½ teaspoonful
of tartaric acid, ½ teaspoonful of salt,
½ teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, 1½
breakfast-cupful of milk, 1 oz. of sifted
loaf sugar, 2 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—These cakes
are made in the same manner as the soda
bread, with the addition of eggs and
sugar. Mix the flour, tartaric acid, and
salt well together, taking care that the
two latter ingredients are reduced to the
finest powder, and stir in the sifted sugar,
which should also be very fine. Dissolve
the soda in the milk, add the eggs, which
should be well whisked, and with this
liquid work the flour, &amp;c. into a light
dough. Divide it into small cakes, put
them into the oven immediately, and
bake for about 20 minutes. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes.</p>


<h3>CAKE, Christmas.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—5 teacupfuls of flour, 1
teacupful of melted butter, 1 teacupful
of cream, 1 teacupful of treacle, 1 teacupful
of moist sugar, 2 eggs, ½ oz. of powdered
ginger, ½ lb. of raisins, 1 teaspoonful
of carbonate of soda, 1 tablespoonful
of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Make the butter
sufficiently warm to melt it, but do not
allow it to oil; put the flour into a basin,
add to it the sugar, ginger, and raisins,
which should be stoned and cut into
small pieces. When these dry ingredients
are thoroughly mixed, stir in the
butter, cream, treacle, and well-whisked
eggs, and beat the mixture for a few
minutes. Dissolve the soda in the vinegar,
add it to the dough, and be particular
that these latter ingredients are
well incorporated with the others; put
the cake into a buttered mould or tin,
place it in a moderate oven immediately,
and bake it from 1¾ to 2¼ hours. <i>Time.</i>—1¾
to 2¼ hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>CAKE, Common (suitable for sending
to Children at School).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of flour, 4 oz. of
butter or clarified dripping, ½ oz. of caraway
seeds, ¼ oz. of allspice, ½ lb. of
pounded sugar, 1 lb. of currants, 1 pint
of milk, 3 tablespoonfuls of fresh yeast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<i>Mode.</i>—Rub the butter lightly into the
flour; add all the dry ingredients, and
mix these well together. Make the milk
warm, but not hot; stir in the yeast, and
with this liquid mix the whole into a
light dough; knead it well, and line the
cake-tins with strips of buttered paper:
this paper should be about 6 inches higher
than the top of the tin. Put in the
dough; stand it in a warm place to rise
for more than an hour, then bake the
cakes in a well-heated oven. If this
quantity be divided into two, they will
take from 1½ to 2 hours’ baking, <i>Time.</i>—1½
to 2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> to make 2 moderate-sized cakes.</p>


<h3>CAKE, Economical.</h3>

<img src="images/illus-056.jpg" width="169" height="108" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">CAKE-MOULD.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ¼ lb. of
sugar, ¼ lb. of butter or lard, ½ lb. of
currants, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of
soda, the whites of 4 eggs, ½ pint of milk.
<i>Mode.</i>—In making many sweet dishes,
the whites of eggs are not required, and
if well beaten and added to the above
ingredients, make an excellent cake with
or without currants.
Beat the butter to a
cream, well whisk
the whites of the
eggs, and stir all the
ingredients together
but the soda, which
must not be added
until all is well mixed, and the cake is
ready to be put into the oven. When
the mixture has been well beaten, stir in
the soda, put the cake into a buttered
mould, and bake it in a moderate oven
for 1½ hour. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>CAKE, Good Holiday.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½<i>d.</i> worth of Borwick’s
German baking-powder, 2 lbs. of flour,
6 oz. of butter, ¼ lb. of lard, 1 lb. of currants,
½ lb. of stoned and cut raisins, ¼ lb.
of mixed candied peel, ½ lb. of moist
sugar, 3 eggs, ¾ pint of cold milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix
the baking-powder with the flour;
then rub in the butter and lard; have
ready the currants, washed, picked, and
dried, the raisins stoned and cut into
small pieces (not chopped), and the peel
cut into neat slices. Add these with the
sugar to the flour, &amp;c., and mix all the
dry ingredients well together. Whisk
the eggs, stir to them the milk, and with
this liquid moisten the cake; beat it up
well, that all may be very thoroughly
mixed; line a cake-tin with buttered
paper, put in the cake, and bake it from
2¼ to 2¾ hours in a good oven. To ascertain
when it is done, plunge a clean
knife into the middle of it, and if, on
withdrawing it, the knife looks clean,
and not sticky, the cake is done. To
prevent it burning at the top, a piece of
clean paper may be put over whilst the
cake is soaking, or being thoroughly
cooked in the middle. A steamer, such
as is used for steaming potatoes, makes
a very good cake-tin, if it be lined at the
bottom and sides with buttered paper.
<i>Time.</i>—2¼ to 2¾ hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

cut the raisins into small pieces; wash,
pick, and dry the currants; melt the
butter to a cream, but without oiling it;
blanch and chop the almonds, and grate
the nutmeg. When all these ingredients
are thus prepared, mix them well together;
make the milk warm, stir in the
soda, and with this liquid make the
whole into a paste. Butter a mould,
rather more than half fill it with the
dough, and bake the cake in a moderate
oven from 1½ to 2 hours, or less time
should it be made into 2 cakes. <i>Time.</i>—1½
to 2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CAKE, a nice Plain.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, 1 teaspoonful
of Borwick’s baking-powder, ¼ lb. of
good dripping, 1 teacupful of moist sugar,
3 eggs, 1 breakfast-cupful of milk, 1 oz.
of caraway seeds, ½ lb. of currants. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the flour and the baking-powder
into a basin; stir these together; then
rub in the dripping, add the sugar, caraway
seeds, and currants; whisk the eggs
with the milk, and beat all together very
thoroughly until the ingredients are
well mixed. Butter a tin, put in the
cake, and bake it from 1½ to 2 hours.
Let the dripping be quite clean before
using: to insure this, it is a good plan
to clarify it. Beef dripping is better
than any other for cakes, &amp;c., as mutton
dripping frequently has a very unpleasant
flavour, which would be imparted to the
preparation. <i>Time.</i>—1½ to 2 hours,
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CAKE, a nice Plain, for Children.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 quartern of dough, ¼ lb.
of moist sugar, ¼ lb. of butter or good
beef dripping, ¼ pint of warm milk, ½
grated nutmeg or ½ oz. of caraway seeds.
<i>Mode.</i>—It you are not in the habit of
making bread at home, procure the
dough from the baker’s, and as soon as
it comes in put it into a basin near the
fire; cover the basin with a thick cloth,
and let the dough remain a little while
to rise. In the mean time, beat the
butter to a cream, and make the milk
warm; and when the dough has risen,
mix with it thoroughly all the above
ingredients, and knead the cake well for
a few minutes. Butter some cake-tins,
half fill them, and stand them in a warm
place, to allow the dough to rise again.
When the tins are three parts full, put
the cakes into a good oven, and bake
them from 1¾ to 2 hours. A few currants
might be substituted for the caraway
seeds when the flavour of the latter is
disliked. <i>Time.</i>—1¾ to 2 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CAKE, Queen.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ½ lb. of
butter, ½ lb. of pounded loaf sugar, 3
eggs, 1 teacupful of cream, ½ lb. of
currants, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of
soda, essence of lemon, or almonds to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Work the butter to a
cream; dredge in the flour, add the
sugar and currants, and mix the ingredients
well together. Whisk the eggs,
mix them with the cream and flavouring,
and stir these to the flour; add the carbonate
of soda, beat the paste well for
10 minutes, put it into small buttered
pans, and bake the cake from ¼ to ½ hour.
Grated lemon-rind may be substituted
for the lemon and almond flavouring,
which will make the cakes equally nice.
<i>Time.</i>—¼ to ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CAKE, Saucer, for Tea.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of flour, ¼ lb. of
<i>tous-les-mois</i>, ¼ lb. of pounded white
sugar, ¼ lb. of butter, 2 eggs, 1 oz. of candied
orange or lemon-peel. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix
the flour and <i>tous-les-mois</i> together; add
the sugar, the candied peel cut into thin
slices, the butter beaten to a cream, and
the eggs well whisked. Beat the mixture
for 10 minutes, put it into a buttered
cake-tin or mould, or, if this is not obtainable,
a soup-plate answers the purpose,
lined with a piece of buttered
paper. Bake the cake in a moderate oven
from 1 to 1¼ hour, and when cold, put
it away in a covered canister. It will
remain good some weeks, even if it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
cut into slices. <i>Time.</i>—1 to 1¼ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CAKES, Scrap.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of leaf, or the inside
fat of a pig; 1½ lb. of flour, ¼ lb. of
moist sugar, ½ lb. of currants, 1 oz. of
candied lemon-peel, ground allspice to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the leaf, or flead, as
it is sometimes called, into small pieces;
put it into a large dish, which place in a
quick oven; be careful that it does not
burn, and in a short time it will be reduced
to oil, with the small pieces of
leaf floating on the surface; and it is of
these that the cakes should be made.
Gather all the scraps together, put them
into a basin with the flour, and rub them
well together. Add the currants, sugar,
candied peel, cut into thin slices, and
the ground allspice. When all these
ingredients are well mixed, moisten with
sufficient cold water to make the whole
into a nice paste; roll it out thin, cut it
into shapes, and bake the cakes in a
quick oven from 15 to 20 minutes. These
are very economical and wholesome cakes
for children, and the lard, melted at
home, produced from the flead, is generally
better than that you purchase. To
prevent the lard from burning, and to
insure its being a good colour, it is better
to melt it in a jar placed in a saucepan
of boiling water; by doing it in this
manner, there will be no chance of its
discolouring. <i>Time.</i>—15 to 20 minutes.
<i>Sufficient</i> to make 3 or 4 dozen cakes.
<i>Seasonable</i> from September to March.</p>


<h3>CALF.</h3>

<p>The manner of cutting up a calf for
the English market is to divide the
carcase into four quarters, with eleven
ribs to each fore quarter; which are
again subdivided into joints, as exemplified
on the cut.</p>

<p><i>Hind quarter:</i>—</p>


<ul class="cuts">
<li>1. The loin.</li>
<li>2. The chump, consisting of the rump and hock-bone.</li>
<li>3. The fillet.</li>
<li>4. The hock, or hind knuckle.</li>
</ul>


<p><i>Fore quarter:</i>—</p>


<ul class="cuts"><li>5. The shoulder.</li>
<li>6. The neck.</li>
<li>7. The breast.</li>
<li>8. The fore knuckle.</li></ul>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/illus-058.jpg" width="256" height="596" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">SIDE OF A CALF, SHOWING
THE SEVERAL JOINTS.</div>
</div>

<p>The several parts of a moderately-sized
well-fed calf, about eight weeks old, are
nearly of the following weights:—loin
and chump 18 lbs., fillet 12½ lbs., hind
knuckle 5½ lbs., shoulder 11 lbs., neck
11 lbs., breast 9 lbs., and fore knuckle
5 lbs.; making a total of 144 lbs. weight.
The London mode of cutting the carcase
is considered better than that pursued
in Edinburgh, as giving three
roasting joints and one boiling in each
quarter; besides the pieces being more
equally divided, as regards flesh, and
from the handsomer appearance they
make on the table.</p>


<h3>CALF’S FEET, Baked or Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 calf’s foot, 1 pint of milk,
1 pint of water, 1 blade of mace, the rind of
½ lemon, pepper and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Well
clean the foot, and either stew
or bake it in the milk-and-water with
the other ingredients from 3 to 4 hours.
To enhance the flavour, an onion and a
small quantity of celery may be added, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
approved; ½ a teacupful of cream, stirred
in just before serving, is also a great
improvement to this dish. <i>Time.</i>—3 to
4 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, in full season,
9<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 person. <i>Seasonable</i>
from March to October.</p>


<h3>CALF’S FEET, Boiled, and
Parsley and Butter.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 calf’s feet, 2 slices of
bacon, 2 oz. of butter, two tablespoonfuls
of lemon-juice, salt and whole
pepper to taste, 1 onion, a bunch of
savoury herbs, 4 cloves, 1 blade of mace,
water, parsley, and butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Procure
2 white calf’s feet; bone them
as far as the first joint, and put them
into warm water to soak for 2 hours.
Then put the bacon, butter, lemon-juice,
onion, herbs, spices, and seasoning into
a stewpan; lay in the feet, and pour in
just sufficient water to cover the whole.
Stew gently for about three hours; take
out the feet, dish them, and cover with
parsley and butter. The liquor they
were boiled in should be strained and put
by in a clean basin for use: it will be
found very good as an addition to gravies,
&amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more than 3 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, in full season, 9<i>d.</i> each.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
March to October.</p>


<h3>CALF’S-FOOT BROTH.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 calf’s foot, 3 pints of
water, 1 small lump of sugar, nutmeg to
taste, the yolk of 1 egg, a piece of butter
the size of a nut. <i>Mode.</i>—Stew the foot
in the water with the lemon-peel <i>very
gently</i>, until the liquid is half wasted,
removing any scum, should it rise to the
surface. Set it by in a basin until quite
cold, then take off every particle of fat.
Warm up about ½ pint of the broth,
adding the butter, sugar, and a very
small quantity of grated nutmeg; take
it off the fire for a minute or two, then
add the beaten yolk of the egg; keep
stirring over the fire until the mixture
thickens, but do not allow it to boil
again after the egg is added, or it will
curdle, and the broth will be spoiled.
<i>Time.</i>—To be boiled until the liquid is
reduced one half. <i>Average cost</i>, in full
season, 9<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> to make 1½
pint of broth. <i>Seasonable</i> from March
to October.</p>


<h3>CALF’S FEET, Fricasseed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A set of calf’s feet; for the
batter, allow for each egg 1 tablespoonful
of flour, 1 tablespoonful of bread-crumbs,
hot lard, or clarified dripping, pepper and
salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—If the feet are purchased
uncleaned, dip them into warm
water repeatedly, and scrape off the hair,
first one foot and then the other, until the
skin looks perfectly clean, a saucepan of
water being kept by the fire until they
are finished. After washing and soaking
in cold water, boil them in just sufficient
water to cover them, until the bones
come easily away. Then pick them out,
and after straining the liquor into a
clean vessel, put the meat into a pie-dish
until the next day. Now cut it down in
slices about ½ inch thick, lay on them a
stiff batter made of egg, flour, and bread-crumbs
in the above proportion; season
with pepper and salt, and plunge them
into a pan of boiling lard. Fry the slices
a nice brown, dry them before the fire
for a minute or two, dish them on a
napkin, and garnish with tufts of parsley.
This should be eaten with melted butter,
mustard, and vinegar. Be careful to
have the lard boiling to <i>set</i> the batter,
or the pieces of feet will run about the
pan. The liquor they were boiled in
should be saved, and will be found useful
for enriching gravies, making jellies, &amp;c.
<i>Time.</i>—About 3 hours to stew the feet,
10 or 15 minutes to fry them. <i>Average
cost</i>, in full season, 9<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from March
to October.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This dish can be highly recommended
to delicate persons.</p>


<h3>CALF’S-FEET JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 quart of calf’s-feet stock,
½ lb. sugar, ½ pint of sherry, 1 glass of
brandy, the shells and whites of 5 eggs,
the rind and juice of 2 lemons, ½ oz. of
isinglass. <i>Mode.</i>—Prepare the stock as
directed in recipe for <a href="#STOCKS">stock</a>, taking care
to leave the sediment, and to remove all
the fat from the surface. Put it into a
saucepan cold, without clarifying it;
add the remaining ingredients, and stir
them well together before the saucepan
is placed on the fire. Then simmer the
mixture gently for ¼ hour, <i>but do not stir
it after it begins to warm</i>. Throw in a
teacupful of cold water, boil for another
5 minutes, and keep the saucepan covered
by the side of the fire for about ½ hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
but do not let it boil again. In simmering,
the head or scum may be carefully
removed as it rises; but particular
attention must be given to the jelly,
that it be not stirred in the slightest
degree after it is heated. The isinglass
should be added when the jelly begins
to boil: this assists to clear it, and makes
it firmer for turning out. Wring out a
jelly-bag in hot water; fasten it on to a
stand, or the back of a chair; place it
near the fire with a basin underneath it,
and run the jelly through it. Should it
not be perfectly clear the first time,
repeat the process until the desired
brilliancy is obtained. Soak the moulds
in water, drain them for half a second,
pour in the jelly, and put it in a cool
place to set. If ice is at hand, surround
the moulds with it, and the jelly will set
sooner, and be firmer when turned out.
In summer it is necessary to have ice in
which to put the moulds, or the cook
will be, very likely, disappointed, by her
jellies being in too liquid a state to turn
out properly, unless a great deal of isinglass
is used. When wanted for table,
dip the moulds in hot water for a minute,
wipe the outside with a cloth, lay a dish
on the top of the mould, turn it quickly
over, and the jelly should slip out easily.
It is sometimes served broken into square
lumps, and piled high in glasses. Earthenware
moulds are preferable to those of
pewter or tin for red jellies, the colour
and transparency of the composition
being often spoiled by using the latter.
To make this jelly more economically,
raisin wine may be substituted for the
sherry and brandy, and the stock made
from cow-heels, instead of calf’s feet.
<i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to simmer the jelly,
½ hour to stand covered. <i>Average cost,</i>
reckoning the feet at 6<i>d.</i> each, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> to fill two 1½-pint moulds.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<div class="caption">JELLY-MOULD.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—As lemon-juice, unless carefully
strained, is liable to make the jelly
muddy, see that it is clear before it is
added to the other ingredients. Omit
the brandy when the flavour is objected
to.</p>


<h3>CALF’S HEAD à la Maître d’Hôtel.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of a cold calf’s head,
rather more than ½ pint of maître
d’hôtel sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Make the sauce
by the given recipe, and have it sufficiently
thick that it may nicely cover
the meat; remove the bones from the
head, and cut the meat into neat slices.
When the sauce is ready, lay in the
meat; <i>gradually</i> warm it through, and,
after it boils up, let it simmer very
gently for 5 minutes, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—Rather
more than 1½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, exclusive of the meat, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
from March to October.</p>


<h3>CALF’S HEAD, Boiled (with the
Skin on).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Calf’s head, boiling
water, bread-crumbs, 1 large bunch of
parsley, butter, white pepper and salt to
taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter,
1 tablespoonful of lemon juice, 2 or 3
grains of cayenne. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the head
into boiling water, and let it remain by
the side of the fire for 3 or 4 minutes; take
it out, hold it by the ear, and with the
back of a knife, scrape off the hair (should
it not come off easily, dip the head again
into boiling water). When perfectly
clean, take the eyes out, cut off the ears,
and remove the brain, which soak for an
hour in warm water. Put the head into
hot water to soak for a few minutes, to
make it look white, and then have ready
a stewpan, into which lay the head; cover
it with cold water, and bring it gradually
to boil. Remove the scum, and add a
little salt, which assists to throw it up.
Simmer it very gently from 2½ to 3 hours,
and when nearly done, boil the brains
for ¼ hour; skin and chop them, not
too finely, and add a tablespoonful of
minced parsley which has been previously
scalded. Season with pepper and salt,
and stir the brains, parsley, &amp;c., into
about 4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter;
add the lemon-juice and cayenne, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
keep these hot by the side of the fire.
Take up the head, cut out the tongue,
skin it, put it on a small dish with the
brains round it; sprinkle over the head
a few bread-crumbs mixed with a little
minced parsley; brown these before the
fire, and serve with a tureen of parsley
and butter, and either boiled bacon,
ham, or pickled pork as an accompaniment.
<i>Time.</i>—2½ to 3 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, according to the season, from 3<i>s.</i> to
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 or 9 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from March to October.</p>


<h3>CALF’S HEAD, Boiled (without
the Skin).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Calf’s head, water, a little
salt, 4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter,
1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, pepper
and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of
lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—After the head
has been thoroughly cleaned, and the
brains removed, soak it in warm water
to blanch it. Lay the brains also into
warm water to soak, and let them remain
for about an hour. Put the head into a
stewpan, with sufficient cold water to
cover it, and, when it boils, add a little
salt; take off every particle of scum as
it rises, and boil the head until perfectly
tender. Boil the brains, chop them, and
mix with them melted butter, minced
parsley, pepper, salt, and lemon-juice in
the above proportion. Take up the head,
skin the tongue, and put it on a small
dish with the brains round it. Have
ready some parsley and butter, smother
the head with it, and the remainder send to
table in a tureen. Bacon, ham, pickled
pork, or a pig’s cheek, are indispensable
with calf s head. The brains are sometimes
chopped with hard-boiled eggs, and
mixed with a little Béchamel or white
sauce. <i>Time.</i>—From 1½ to 2¼ hours.
<i>Average cost,</i> according to the season,
from 3<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from March to October.</p>

<div class="caption">HALF A CALF’S HEAD.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The liquor in which the head
was boiled should be saved: it makes
excellent soup, and will be found a nice
addition to gravies, &amp;c. Half a calf’s
head is as frequently served as a whole
one, it being a more convenient-sized
joint for a small family. It is cooked in
the same manner, and served with the
same sauces, as in the preceding recipe.</p>


<h3>CALF’S HEAD, Collared.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A calf’s head, 4 tablespoonfuls
of minced parsley, 4 blades of
pounded mace, ½ teaspoonful of grated
nutmeg, white pepper to taste, a few
thick slices of ham, the yolks of 6 eggs
boiled hard. <i>Mode.</i>—Scald the head for
a few minutes; take it out of the water,
and with a blunt knife scrape off all the
hair. Clean it nicely, divide the head
and remove the brains. Boil it tender
enough to take out the bones, which will
be in about 2 hours. When the head is
boned, flatten it on the table, sprinkle
over it a thick layer of parsley, then a
layer of ham, and then the yolks of the
eggs cut into thin rings and put a seasoning
of pounded mace, nutmeg, and white
pepper between each layer; roll the head
up in a cloth, and tie it up as tightly as
possible. Boil it for 4 hours, and when
it is taken out of the pot, place a heavy
weight on the top, the same as for other
collared meats. Let it remain till cold;
then remove the cloth and binding, and it
will be ready to serve. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
6 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>s.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> each.
<i>Seasonable</i> from March to October.</p>


<h3>CALF’S HEAD, Fricasseed (an
Entrée).</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of a boiled calf’s head,
1½ pint of the liquor in which the head
was boiled, 1 blade of pounded mace,
1 onion minced, a bunch of savoury
herbs, salt and white pepper to taste,
thickening of butter and flour, the; yolks
of 2 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice,
forcemeat balls. <i>Mode.</i>—Remove all the
bones from the head, and cut the meat
into nice square pieces. Put 1½ pint of
the liquor it was boiled in into a saucepan,
with mace, onions, herbs, and seasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in the above proportion: let this simmer
gently for ¾ hour, then strain it and put
in the meat. When quite hot through,
thicken the gravy with a little butter
rolled in flour, and, just before dishing
the fricassee, put in the beaten yolks of
eggs, and lemon-juice; but be particular,
after these two latter ingredients are
added, that the sauce does not boil, or it
will curdle. Garnish with forcemeat
balls and curled slices of broiled bacon.
To insure the sauce being smooth, it is
a good plan to dish the meat first, and
then to add the eggs to the gravy: when
these are set, the sauce may be poured
over the meat. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 1¼
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the
meat, 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>CALF’S HEAD, Hashed.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of a cold boiled calf’s head,
1 quart of the liquor in which it was
boiled, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1 onion,
1 carrot, a strip of lemon-peel, 2 blades
of pounded mace, salt and white pepper

into a stewpan with the above proportion
of liquor that the head was boiled in.
Add a bunch of savoury herbs, 1 onion,
1 carrot, a strip of lemon-peel, and
2 blades of pounded mace, and let these
boil for 1 hour, or until the gravy is
reduced nearly half. Strain it into a
clean stewpan, thicken it with a little
butter and flour, and add a flavouring of
sherry, lemon-juice, and ketchup, in the
above proportion; season with pepper,
salt, and a little cayenne; put in the
meat, let it <i>gradually</i> warm through, but
not boil more than <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> minutes.
Garnish the dish with forcemeat balls
and pieces of bacon rolled and toasted,
placed alternately, and send it to table
very hot. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether 1½ hour.

the head, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from March to
October.</p>


<h3>CALF’S HEAD, Moulded.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of a calf’s head, some thin
slices of ham or bacon, 6 or 8 eggs boiled
hard, 1 dessertspoonful of salt, pepper,
mixed spice, and parsley, ½ pint of good
white gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the head into
thin slices. Butter a tin mould, cut the
yolks of eggs in half, and put some of
them round the tin; sprinkle some of
the parsley, spice, &amp;c., over it; then put
in the head and the bacon in layers,
adding occasionally more eggs and spice
till the whole of the head is used. Pour
in the gravy, cover the top with a thin
paste of flour and water, and bake ¾ of
an hour. Take off the paste, and, when
cold, turn it out. <i>Time.</i>—From ¾ to
1 hour to bake the preparation. <i>Seasonable</i>

<h3>CALF’S HEAD, to Carve.</h3>

<p>This is not altogether the most easy-looking
dish to cut when it is put before
a carver for the first time; there is not
much real difficulty in the operation, however,
when the head has been attentively
examined, and, after the manner of a
phrenologist, you get to know its bumps,
good and bad. In the first place, inserting
the knife
quite down to
the bone, cut
slices in the direction
of the
line 1 to 2; with
each of these
should be helped
a piece of what is called the throat
sweetbread, cut in the direction of from
3 to 4. The eye, and the flesh round,
are favourite morsels with many, and
should be given to those at the table who
are known to be the greatest connoisseurs.
The jawbone being removed, there will
then be found some nice lean; and the
palate, which is reckoned by some a tit-bit,
lies under the head. On a separate
dish there is always served the tongue
and brains, and each guest should be
asked to take some of these.</p>

when strain off and bottle for use. This
is excellent seasoning for soups or sauces,
but must be used very sparingly.</p>

</div>

<p>With a good heart, and nicely blanched,
this vegetable is generally eaten raw, and
is usually served with the cheese. Let
the roots be washed free from dirt, all
the decayed and outside leaves being
cut off, preserving as much of the stalk
as possible, and all specks or blemishes
being carefully removed. Should the
celery be large, divide it lengthwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
into quarters, and place it, root downwards,
in a celery-glass, which should be
rather more than
half filled with
water. The top
leaves may be
curled, by shredding
them in narrow
strips with
the point of a
clean skewer, at
a distance of
about 4 inches
from the top.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>d.</i>
per head. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 2
heads for 4 or 5
persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from October to April.</p>



<p><i>Note.</i>—This vegetable is exceedingly
useful for flavouring soups, sauces, &amp;c.,
and makes a very nice addition to winter
salad.</p>


<h3>CELERY SAUCE, for Boiled Turkey,
Poultry, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 heads of celery, 1 pint
of white stock, 2 blades of mace, 1 small
bunch of savoury herbs; thickening of
butter and flour, or arrowroot, ½ pint of
cream, lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the
celery in salt and water until tender, and
cut it into pieces 2 inches long. Put the
stock into a stewpan with the mace and
herbs, and let it simmer for ½ hour to
extract their flavour. Then strain the
liquor, add the celery, and a thickening
of butter kneaded with flour, or, what is
still better, with arrowroot; just before
serving, put in the cream, boil it up, and
squeeze in a little lemon-juice. If necessary,
add a seasoning of salt and white
pepper. <i>Time.</i>—25 minutes to boil the
celery. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>,
this quantity for a boiled turkey.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This sauce may be made brown
by using gravy instead of white stock,
and flavouring it with mushroom ketchup
or Harvey’s sauce.</p>


<h3>CELERY SAUCE (a more simple
Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 heads of celery, ½ pint
of melted butter made with milk, 1 blade
of pounded mace; salt and white pepper
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the celery, boil
it in salt and water till tender, and cut
it into pieces 2 inches long; make ½ pint
melted butter by recipe; put in the
celery, pounded mace, and seasoning;
simmer for 3 minutes, when the sauce
will be ready to serve. <i>Time.</i>—25 minutes
to boil the celery. <i>Average cost</i>,
6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>, this quantity for a boiled
fowl.</p>


<h3>CELERY SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—9 heads of celery, 1 teaspoonful
of salt, nutmeg to taste, 1 lump
of sugar, ½ pint of strong stock, a pint of
cream, and 2 quarts of boiling water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut the celery into small pieces;
throw it into the water, seasoned with the
nutmeg, salt, and sugar. Boil it till sufficiently
tender; pass it through a sieve,
add the stock, and simmer it for half an
hour. Now put in the cream, bring it to
the boiling-point, and serve immediately.
<i>Time.</i>—1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per
quart. <i>Seasonable</i> from September to
March. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This soup can be made brown
instead of white, by omitting the cream,
and colouring it a little. When celery
cannot be procured, half a drachm of the
seed, finely pounded, will give a flavour
to the soup, if put in a quarter of an hour
before it is done. A little of the essence
of celery will answer the same purpose.</p>


<h3>CELERY, Stewed, à la Crême.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 heads of celery; to each
½ gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful
of salt, 1 blade of pounded mace,
1/3 pint of cream. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the
celery thoroughly; trim, and boil it in
salt and water until tender. Put the
cream and pounded mace into a stewpan,
shake it over the fire until the cream
thickens, dish the celery, pour over the
sauce, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—Large heads
of celery, 25 minutes; small ones, 15 to
20 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>d.</i> per head.

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 heads of celery, 1 oz.
of butter; to each half gallon of water
allow 1 heaped teaspoonful of salt, ½ pint
of white sauce (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#WHITE_SAUCE_Good">White Sauce</a></span>). <i>Mode.</i>—Have
ready sufficient boiling water just
to cover the celery, with salt and butter
in the above proportion. Wash the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
celery well, cut off the decayed outside
leaves, trim away the green tops, and
shape the root into a point; put it into
the boiling water, let it boil rapidly until
tender, then take it out, drain well, place
it upon a dish, and pour over it about
½ pint of white sauce, made by recipe.
It may also be plainly boiled as
above, placed on toast, and melted butter
poured over, the same as asparagus
is dished. <i>Time.</i>—Large heads of celery
25 minutes, small ones 15 to 20 minutes,
after the water boils. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>d.</i>
per head. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.

<h3>CELERY, Stewed (with White
Sauce).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 heads of celery, ½ pint
of white stock or weak broth, 4 tablespoonfuls
of cream, thickening of butter
and flour, 1 blade of pounded mace, a
<i>very little</i> grated nutmeg; pepper and
salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the celery,
strip off the outer leaves, and cut it into
lengths of about 4 inches. Put these
into a saucepan, with the broth, and
stow till tender, which will be in from

ingredients, simmer altogether for 4 or 5
minutes, pour into a dish, and serve. It
may be garnished with sippets of toasted
bread. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>d.</i> per head. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5
or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from October
to April.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—By cutting the celery into
smaller pieces, by stewing it a little
longer, and, when done, by pressing it
through a sieve, the above stew may be
converted into a Purée of Celery.</p>


<h3>CELERY VINEGAR.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ oz. of celery-seed, 1
pint of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Crush the seed
by pounding it in a mortar; boil the
vinegar, and when cold, pour it to the
seed; let it infuse for a fortnight, when
strain and bottle off for use. This is
frequently used in salads.</p>


<h3>CHAMPAGNE-CUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 quart bottle of champagne,
2 bottles of soda-water, 1 liqueur-glass
of brandy or Curaçoa, 2 tablespoonfuls
of powdered sugar, 1 lb. of pounded
ice, a sprig of green borage. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
all the ingredients into a silver cup;
stir them together, and serve the same
as claret-cup. Should the above proportion
of sugar not be found sufficient to
suit some tastes, increase the quantity.
When borage is not easily obtainable,
substitute for it a few slices of cucumber-rind.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Suitable for pic-nics
balls, weddings, and other festive occasions.</p>


<h3>CHARLOTTE-AUX-POMMES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A few slices of rather
stale bread ½ inch thick, clarified butter,
apple marmalade, with about 2 dozen
apples, ½ glass of sherry. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut a
slice of bread the same shape as the bottom
of a plain round mould, which has
been well buttered, and a few strips the
height of the mould, and about 1½ inch
wide; dip the
bread in clarified
butter
(or spread it
with cold butter,
if not
wanted quite
so rich); place
the round
piece at the bottom of the mould, and
set the narrow strips up the sides of it,
overlapping each other a little, that no
juice from the apples may escape, and
that they may hold firmly to the mould.
Brush the <i>interior</i> over with the white of
egg (this will assist to make the case
firmer); fill it with the apple marmalade,
with the addition of a little sherry, and
cover them with a round piece of bread,
also brushed over with egg, the same as
the bottom; slightly press the bread
down to make it adhere to the other
pieces; put a plate on the top, and bake
the <i>charlotte</i> in a brisk oven, of a light
colour. Turn it out on the dish, strew
sifted sugar over the top, and pour round
it a little melted apricot jam. <i>Time.</i>—40
to 50 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from July to March.</p>

<h3>CHARLOTTE-AUX-POMMES,
an easy method of making.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of flour, ¼ lb. of
butter, ¼ lb. of powdered sugar, ½ teaspoonful
of baking-powder, 1 egg, milk,
1 glass of raisin-wine, apple marmalade,
¼ pint of cream, 2 dessert spoonfuls of
pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<i>Mode.</i>—Make a cake with the flour,
butter, sugar, and baking-powder; moisten
with the egg and sufficient milk to
make it the proper consistency, and bake
it in a round tin. When cold, scoop out
the middle, leaving a good thickness all
round the sides, to prevent them breaking;
take some of the scooped-out
pieces, which should be trimmed into
neat slices; lay them in the cake, and
pour over sufficient raisin-wine, with the
addition of a little brandy, if approved,
to soak them well. Have ready some
apple marmalade, made by recipe; place
a layer of this over the soaked cake, then
a layer of cake and a layer of apples;
whip the cream to a froth, mixing with
it the sugar and lemon-juice; pile it on
the top of the <i>charlotte</i>, and garnish it
with pieces of clear apple jelly. This
dish is served cold, but may be eaten hot
by omitting the cream, and merely garnishing
the top with bright jelly just
before it is sent to table. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour
to bake the cake. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from July to March.</p>


<h3>CHARLOTTE, Russe (an elegant
Sweet Entremets).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—About 18 Savoy biscuits,
¾ pint of cream, flavouring of vanilla,
liqueurs, or wine, 1 tablespoonful of
pounded sugar, ½ oz. of isinglass. <i>Mode.</i>—Procure
about 18 Savoy biscuits, or
ladies’-fingers, as they are sometimes
called; brush the edges of them with the
white of an egg, and line the bottom of a
plain round mould, placing them like
a star or rosette. Stand them upright
all round the edge, carefully put them so
closely together that the white of egg
connects them firmly, and place this case
in the oven for about 5 minutes, just to
dry the egg. Whisk the cream to a stiff
froth, with the sugar, flavouring, and
melted isinglass; fill the charlotte with
it, cover with a slice of sponge-cake cut
in the shape of the mould; place it in
ice, where let it remain till ready for
table; then turn it on a dish, remove
the mould, and serve. 1 tablespoonful
of liqueur of any kind, or 4 tablespoonfuls
of wine, would nicely flavour the above
proportion of cream. For arranging the
biscuits in the mould, cut them to the
shape required, so that they fit in nicely,
and level them with the mould at the
top, that, when turned out, there may be
something firm to rest upon. Great care
and attention is required in the turning
out of this dish, that the cream does not
burst the case; and the edges of the biscuits
must have the smallest quantity of
egg brushed over them, or it would stick
to the mould, and so prevent the charlotte
from coming away properly. <i>Time.</i>—5
minutes in the oven. <i>Average cost</i>,
with cream at 1<i>s.</i> per pint, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 1 charlotte. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>CHEESE.</h3>

<p>Cheese is the curd formed from milk by
artificial coagulation, pressed and dried for
use. Curd, called also casein and caseous
matter, or the basis of cheese, exists in
the milk, and not in the cream, and requires
only to be separated by coagulation:
the coagulation, however, supposes
some alteration of the curd. By means
of the substance employed to coagulate
it, it is rendered insoluble in water.
When the curd is freed from the whey,
kneaded and pressed to expel it entirely,
it becomes cheese; this assumes a degree
of transparency, and possesses many of
the properties of coagulated albumen.
If it be well dried, it does not change by
exposure to the air; but if it contain
moisture, it soon putrefies; it therefore
requires some salt to preserve it, and this
acts likewise as a kind of seasoning. All
our cheese is coloured more or less, except
that made from skim milk. The
colouring substances employed are arnatto,
turmeric, or marigold, all perfectly
harmless unless they are adulterated;
and it is said that arnatto sometimes
contains red lead.</p>

<p>Cheese varies in quality and richness
according to the materials of which it is
composed. It is made—1. Of entire milk,
as in Cheshire; 2. of milk and cream, as
at Stilton; 3. of new milk mixed with
skim milk, as in Gloucestershire; 4. of
skimmed milk only, as in Suffolk, Holland,
and Italy.</p>

<p>The principal varieties of cheese used
in England are the following: <i>Cheshire
cheese</i>, famed all over Europe for its rich
quality and fine piquante flavour. It is
made of entire new milk, the cream not
being taken off. <i>Gloucester cheese</i> is much
milder in its taste than the Cheshire.
There are two kinds of Gloucester cheese,
single and double:—<i>Single Gloucester</i> is
made of skimmed milk, or of the milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
deprived of half the cream; <i>Double
Gloucester</i> is a cheese that pleases almost
every palate: it is made of the whole
milk and cream. <i>Stilton cheese</i> is made
by adding the cream of one day to the
entire milk of the next: it was first made
at Stilton, in Leicestershire. <i>Sage cheese</i>
is so called from the practice of colouring
some curd with bruised sage, marigold-leaves,
and parsley, and mixing this
with some uncoloured curd. With the
Romans, and during the middle ages,
this practice was extensively adopted.
<i>Cheddar cheese</i> much resembles Parmesan.
It has a very agreeable taste and flavour,
and has a spongy appearance. <i>Brickbat
cheese</i> has nothing remarkable except its
form. It is made by turning with rennet
a mixture of cream and new milk; the
curd is put into a wooden vessel the
shape of a brick, and is then pressed and
dried in the usual way. <i>Dunlop cheese</i>
has a peculiarly mild and rich taste: the
best is made entirely from new milk.
<i>New cheese</i> (as it is called in London) is
made chiefly in Lincolnshire, and is either
made of all cream, or, like Stilton, by
adding the cream of one day’s milking
to the milk that comes immediately from
the cow: they are extremely thin, and
are compressed gently two or three times,
turned for a few days, and then eaten
new with radishes, salad, &amp;c. <i>Skimmed
Milk cheese</i> is made for sea voyages principally.
<i>Parmesan cheese</i> is made in
Parma and Piacenza. It is the most
celebrated of all cheese: it is made entirely
of skimmed cows’ milk; the high
flavour which it has is supposed to be
owing to the rich herbage of the meadows
of the Po, where the cows are pastured.
The best Parmesan is kept for three or
four years, and none is carried to market
till it is at least six months old. <i>Dutch
cheese</i> derives its peculiar pungent taste
from the practice adopted in Holland of
coagulating the milk with muriatic acid
instead of rennet. <i>Swiss cheeses</i>, in their
several varieties, are all remarkable for
their fine flavour; that from <i>Gruyère</i>, a
bailiwick in the canton of Fribourg, is
best known in England; it is flavoured
by the dried herb of <i>Melilotus officinalis</i>
in powder. Cheese from milk and potatoes
is manufactured in Thuringia and
Saxony. <i>Cream cheese</i>, although so called,
is not properly cheese, but is nothing
more than cream dried sufficiently to be
cut with a knife.</p>

<p>In families where much cheese is consumed,
and it is bought in large quantities,
a piece from the whole cheese
should be cut, the larger quantity spread
with a thickly-buttered sheet of white
paper, and the outside occasionally wiped.
To keep cheeses moist that are in daily
use, when they come from table a damp
cloth should be wrapped round them,
and the cheese put into a pan with a
cover to it, in a cool but not very dry
place. To ripen cheeses, and bring them
forward, put them into a damp cellar;
and to check too large a production of
mites, spirits may be poured into the
parts affected. Pieces of cheese which
are too near the rind, or too dry to put
on table, may be made into Welsh rarebits,
or grated down and mixed with
macaroni. Cheeses may be preserved in
a perfect state for years, by covering
them with parchment made pliable by
soaking in water, or by rubbing them
over with a coating of melted fat. The
cheeses selected should be free from
cracks or bruises of any kind.</p>

<h3>CHEESE, Mode of Serving.</h3>

<p>The usual mode of serving cheese at
good tables is to cut a small quantity of
it into neat square pieces, and to put
them into a glass cheese-dish, this dish
being handed
round. Should
the cheese crumble
much, of
course this method
is rather
wasteful, and it
may then be put on the table in the
piece, and the host may cut from it.
When served thus, the cheese must always
be carefully scraped, and laid on
a white d’oyley or napkin, neatly folded.
Cream cheese is often served in a cheese
course, and, sometimes, grated Parmesan:
the latter should be put into a
covered glass dish. Rusks, cheese-biscuits,
pats or slices of butter, and salad,
cucumber, or water-cresses, should always
form part of a cheese-course.</p>


<h3>CHEESE, Pounded.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of cheese
allow 3 oz. of fresh butter. <i>Mode.</i>—To
pound cheese is an economical way of
using it if it has become dry; it is exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
good spread on bread, and is
the best way of eating it for those whose
digestion is weak. Cut up the cheese
into small pieces, and pound it smoothly
in a mortar, adding butter in the above
proportion. Press it down into a jar,
cover with clarified butter, and it will
keep for several days. The flavour may
be very much increased by adding mixed
mustard (about a teaspoonful to every
lb.), or cayenne, or pounded mace. Curry-powder
is also not infrequently mixed
with it.</p>


<h3>CHEESE, Toasted, or Scotch Rarebit.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A few slices of rich
cheese, toast, mustard, and pepper.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut some nice rich sound cheese
into rather thin slices; melt it in a
cheese-toaster on a hot plate or over
steam, and, when melted, add a small
quantity of mixed mustard and a seasoning
of pepper; stir the cheese until it is
completely dissolved, then brown it before
the fire, or with a salamander. Fill
the bottom of the cheese-toaster with
hot water, and serve with dry or buttered
toasts, whichever may be preferred. Our
engraving illustrates
a cheese-toaster
with
hot-water reservoir:
the
cheese is melted
in the upper tin, which is placed in another
vessel of boiling water, so keeping
the preparation beautifully hot. A small
quantity of porter, or port wine, is sometimes
mixed with the cheese; and, if it
be not very rich, a few pieces of butter
may be mixed with it to great advantage.
Sometimes the melted cheese is spread
on the toasts, and then laid in the cheese-dish
at the top of the hot water. Whichever
way it is served, it is highly necessary
that the mixture be very hot, and
very quickly sent to table, or it will be
worthless. <i>Time.</i>—About 5 minutes to
melt the cheese. <i>Average cost</i>, 1½<i>d.</i> per
slice. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow a slice to each
person. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<div class="caption">HOT-WATER CHEESE-DISH.</div>
</div>


<h3>CHEESE, Toasted, or Welsh Rarebit.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Slices of bread, butter,
Cheshire or Gloucester cheese, mustard,
and pepper. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the bread into
slices about ½ inch in thickness; pare off
the crust, toast the bread slightly without
hardening or burning it, and spread
it with butter. Cut some slices, not
quite so large as the bread, from a good
rich fat cheese; lay them on the toasted
bread in a cheese-toaster; be careful that
the cheese does not burn, and let it be
equally melted. Spread over the top a
little made mustard and a seasoning of
pepper, and serve very hot, with very
hot plates. To facilitate the melting of
the cheese, it may be cut into thin flakes,
or toasted on one side before it is laid
on the bread. As it is so essential to
send this dish hot to table, it is a good
plan to melt the cheese in small round
silver or metal pans, and to send these
pans to table, allowing one for each
guest. Slices of dry or buttered toast
should always accompany them, with
mustard, pepper, and salt. <i>Time.</i>—About
5 minutes to melt the cheese.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1½<i>d.</i> per slice. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
a slice to each person. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Should the cheese be dry, a
little butter mixed with it will be an
improvement.</p>


<h3>CHEESE SANDWICHES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Slices of brown bread-and-butter,
thin slices of cheese. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
from a nice fat Cheshire, or any
good rich cheese, some slices about ½ inch
thick, and place them between some
slices of brown bread-and-butter, like
sandwiches. Place them on a plate in
the oven, and, when the bread is toasted,
serve on a napkin very hot and very
quickly. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes in a brisk
oven. <i>Average cost</i>, 1½<i>d.</i> each sandwich.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow a sandwich for each
person. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CHEESECAKES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 oz. of pressed curds,
2 oz. of ratafias, 6 oz. of sugar, 2 oz. of
butter, the yolks of 6 eggs, nutmegs,
salt, rind of 2 oranges or lemons. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub
the sugar on the orange or lemon
rind, and scrape it off. Press the curd
in a napkin, to get rid of moisture; pound
it thoroughly in a mortar with the other
ingredients till the whole becomes a soft
paste. Line 2 dozen, or more, tartlet-pans
with good puff-paste, garnish these
with the cheese-custard, place a strip of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
candied-peel on the top of each, and bake
in a moderate oven a light colour; when
done, shake a little sifted sugar over
them. Currants, dried cherries, sultanas,
and citron may be used instead
of candied-peel. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to
bake. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per dozen. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>CHEROKEE, or Store Sauce.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ oz. of cayenne pepper,
5 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoonfuls of soy,
1 tablespoonful of walnut ketchup, 1 pint
of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil all the ingredients
<i>gently</i> for about ½ hour; strain
the liquor, and bottle off for use. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This sauce can
be made at any time.</p>


<h3>CHERRIES, Dried.</h3>

<p>Cherries may be put into a slow oven
and thoroughly dried before they begin
to change colour; they should then be
taken out of the oven, tied in bunches,
and stored away in a dry place. In the
winter, they may be cooked with sugar
for dessert, the same as Normandy pippins.
Particular care must be taken that
the oven be not too hot. Another method
of drying cherries is to stone them,
and to put them into a preserving-pan,
with plenty of loaf sugar strewed amongst
them. They should be simmered till
the fruit shrivels, when they should be
strained from the juice. The cherries
should then be placed in an oven cool
enough to dry without baking them.
About 5 oz. of sugar would be required
for 1 lb. of cherries, and the same syrup
may be used again to do another quantity
of fruit.</p>


<h3>CHERRIES, Morello, to Preserve.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of cherries
allow 1¼ lb. of sugar, 1 gill of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Select ripe cherries, pick off the
stalks, and reject all that have any blemishes.
Boil the sugar and water together
for 5 minutes; put in the cherries,
and boil them for 10 minutes, removing
the scum as it rises. Then turn the fruit,
&amp;c., into a pan, and let it remain until
the next day, when boil it all again for
another 10 minutes, and, if necessary,
skim well. Put the cherries into small
pots, pour over them the syrup, and,
when cold, cover down with oiled papers,
and the tops of the jars with tissue-paper
brushed over on both sides with the white
of an egg, and keep in a dry place. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
25 minutes to boil. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 8<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i> per lb. pot.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in July or August.</p>


<h3>CHERRIES, to Preserve in Syrup
(very delicious).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 lbs. of cherries, 3 lbs.
of sugar, 1 pint of white-currant juice.
<i>Mode.</i>—Let the cherries be as clear and
as transparent as possible, and perfectly
ripe; pick off the stalks, and remove the
stones, damaging the fruit as little as
you can. Make a syrup with the above
proportion of sugar, mix the cherries
with it, and boil them for about 15 minutes,
carefully skimming them; turn
them gently into a pan, and let them
remain till the next day, then drain the
cherries on a sieve, and put the syrup
and white-currant juice into the preserving-pan
again. Boil these together
until the syrup is somewhat reduced and
rather thick, then put in the cherries,
and let them boil for about 5 minutes;
take them off the fire, skim the syrup,
put the cherries into small pots or wide-mouthed
bottles; pour the syrup over,
and, when quite cold, tie them down
carefully, so that the air is quite excluded.
<i>Time.</i>—15 minutes to boil the cherries
in the syrup; 10 minutes to boil the
syrup and currant-juice; 5 minutes to
boil the cherries the second time. <i>Average
cost</i> for this quantity, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in July or August.</p>


<h3>CHERRY BRANDY, to make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Morello cherries, good
brandy; to every lb. of cherries allow
3 oz. of pounded sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Have
ready some glass bottles, which must be
perfectly dry. Ascertain that the cherries
are not too ripe and are freshly
gathered, and cut off about half of the
stalks. Put them into the bottles, with
the above proportion of sugar to every
lb. of fruit; strew this in between the
cherries, and, when the bottles are nearly
full, pour in sufficient brandy to reach
just below the cork. A few peach or
apricot kernels will add much to their
flavour, or a few blanched bitter almonds.
Put corks or bungs into the bottles, tie
over them a piece of bladder, and store
away in a dry place. The cherries will
be fit to eat in 2 or 3 months, and will
remain good for years. They are liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to shrivel and become tough if too much
sugar be added to them. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—1 lb. of
cherries and about a ¼ pint of brandy for
a quart bottle. <i>Seasonable</i> in August
and September.</p>


<h3>CHERRY JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit,
weighed before stoning, allow ½ lb. of
sugar; to every 6 lbs. of fruit allow
1 pint of red-currant juice, and to every
pint of juice 1 lb. of sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Weigh
the fruit before stoning, and allow
half the weight of sugar; stone the cherries,
and boil them in a preserving-pan
until nearly all the juice is dried up, then
add the sugar, which should be crushed
to powder, and the currant-juice, allowing
1 pint to every 6 lbs. of cherries (original
weight), and 1 lb. of sugar to every
pint of juice. Boil all together until it
jellies, which will be in from 20 minutes
to ½ hour; skim the jam well, keep it
well stirred, and, a few minutes before it
is done, crack some of the stones, and
add the kernels: these impart a very
delicious flavour to the jam. <i>Time.</i>—According
to the quality of the cherries,
from ¾ to 1 hour to boil them; 20 minutes
to ½ hour with the sugar. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 7<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per lb. pot. <i>Sufficient.</i>—1
pint of fruit for a lb. pot of jam.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in July or August.</p>


<h3>CHERRY SAUCE, for Sweet Puddings
(German Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of cherries, 1 tablespoonful
of flour, 1 oz. of butter, ½ pint
of water, 1 wineglassful of port wine,
a little grated lemon-rind, 4 pounded
cloves, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice,
sugar to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Stone the cherries,
and pound the kernels in a mortar
to a smooth paste; put the butter and
flour into a saucepan, stir them over the
fire until of a pale brown, then add the
cherries, the pounded kernels, the wine,
and the water. Simmer these gently
for ¼ hour, or until the cherries are
quite cooked, and rub the whole through
a hair sieve; add the remaining ingredients,
let the sauce boil for another
5 minutes, and serve. This is a delicious
sauce to serve with boiled batter
pudding, and when thus used, should
be sent to table poured over the pudding.
<i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to ½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or
5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in June, July, and
August.</p>


<h3>CHERRY TART.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of cherries, 2 small
tablespoonfuls of moist sugar, ½ lb. of
short crust. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick the stalks
from the cherries, put them, with the
sugar, into a <i>deep</i> pie-dish just capable
of holding them, with a small cup placed
upside down in the midst of them. Make
a short crust with ½ lb. of flour, by either
of the recipes for short crust, lay a border
round the edge of the dish, put on
the cover, and ornament the edges; bake
in a brisk oven from ½ hour to 40 minutes;
strew finely-sifted sugar over,
and serve hot or cold, although the latter
is the more usual mode. It is more
economical to make two or three tarts at
one time, as the trimmings from one tart
answer for lining the edges of the dish
for another, and so much paste is not
required as when they are made singly.
Unless for family use, never make fruit
pies in very <i>large</i> dishes; select them,
however, as <i>deep</i> as possible. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour to 40 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, in
full season, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in June, July, and
August.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A few currants added to the
cherries will be found to impart a nice
piquante taste to them.</p>


<h3>CHESTNUT SAUCE, Brown.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of chestnuts, ½ pint
of stock, 2 lumps of sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls
of Spanish sauce (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#SAUCES">Sauces</a></span>). <i>Mode.</i>—Prepare
the chestnuts as in the succeeding
recipe, by scalding and peeling
them; put them in a stewpan with the
stock and sugar, and simmer them till
tender. When done, add Spanish sauce
in the above proportion, and rub the
whole through a tammy. Keep this
sauce rather liquid, as it is liable to
thicken. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour to simmer the
chestnuts. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>CHESTNUT SAUCE, for Fowls
or Turkey.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of chestnuts, ½ pint
of white stock, 2 strips of lemon-peel,
cayenne to taste, ¼ pint of cream or milk.
<i>Mode.</i>—Peel off the outside skin of the
chestnuts, and put them into boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
water for a few minutes; take off the
thin inside peel, and put them into a
saucepan with the white stock and lemon-peel,
and let them simmer for 1½ hour,
or until the chestnuts are quite tender.
Rub the whole through a hair-sieve with
a wooden spoon; add seasoning and the
cream; let it just simmer, but not boil,
and keep stirring all the time. Serve
very hot, and quickly. If milk is used
instead of cream, a very small quantity
of thickening may be required: that, of
course, the cook will determine. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
nearly 2 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>, this quantity for a
turkey.</p>


<h3>CHESTNUT (Spanish) SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ lb. of Spanish chestnuts,
¼ pint of cream; seasoning to taste
of salt, cayenne, and mace; 1 quart of
stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Take the outer rind from
the chestnuts, and put them into a large
pan of warm water. As soon as this
becomes too hot for the fingers to remain
in it, take out the chestnuts, peel them
quickly, and immerse them in cold water,
and wipe and weigh them. Now cover
them with good stock, and stew them
gently for rather more than ¾ of an hour,
or until they break when touched with a
fork; then drain, pound, and rub them
through a fine sieve reversed; add sufficient
stock, mace, cayenne, and salt, and
stir it often until it boils, and put in the
cream. The stock in which the chestnuts
are boiled can be used for the soup,
when its sweetness is not objected to,
or it may, in part, be added to it; and
the rule is, that ¾ lb. of chestnuts should
be given to each quart of soup. <i>Time.</i>—Rather
more than 1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
per quart, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from October to February.</p>


<h3>CHICKENS, Boiled.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 264px;">
<img src="images/illus-075.jpg" width="264" height="107" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">BOILED FOWL.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A pair of chickens, water.
<i>Choosing and Trussing.</i>—In choosing
fowls for boiling, it should be borne
in mind that those which are not black-legged
are generally much whiter when
dressed. Pick, draw, singe, wash, and
truss them in the following manner,
without the livers in the wings; and, in
drawing, be careful not to break the
gall-bladder:—Cut off the neck, leaving
sufficient skin to skewer back. Cut the
feet off to the first joint, tuck the stumps
into a slit made on each side of the belly,
twist the wings over the back of the fowl,
and secure the top of the leg and the
bottom of the wing together by running
a skewer through them and the body.
The other side must be done in the same
manner. Should the fowl be very large
and old, draw the sinews of the legs
before tucking them in. Make a slit in
the apron of the fowl, large enough to
admit the parson’s nose, and tie a string
on the tops of the legs to keep them in
their proper place. <i>Mode.</i>—When they
are firmly trussed, put them into a stewpan
with plenty of hot water, bring it to
boil, and carefully remove all the scum
as it rises. <i>Simmer very gently</i> until the
fowl is tender, and bear in mind that the
slower it boils the plumper and whiter
will the fowl be. Many cooks wrap them
in a floured cloth to preserve the colour,
and to prevent the scum from clinging
to them; in this case, a few slices of
lemon should be placed on the breasts,
over these a sheet of buttered paper, and
then the cloth; cooking them in this
manner renders the flesh very white.
Boiled ham, bacon, boiled tongue, or
pickled pork, are the usual accompaniments
to boiled fowls, and they may be
served with Béchamel, white sauce, parsley
and butter, oyster, lemon, liver,
celery, or mushroom sauce. A little
should be poured over the fowls after the
skewers are removed, and the remainder
sent in a tureen to table. <i>Time.</i>—Large
fowl, 1 hour; moderate-sized one, ¾ hour;
chicken, from 20 minutes to ½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, in full season, 5<i>s.</i> the pair.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year, but scarce in early spring.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN BROTH.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ fowl, or the inferior
joints of a whole one; 1 quart of water,
1 blade of mace, ½ onion, a small bunch
of sweet herbs, salt to taste, 10 peppercorns.
<i>Mode.</i>—An old fowl not suitable
for eating may be converted into very
good broth; or, if a young one be used,
the inferior joints may be put in the
broth, and the best pieces reserved for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
dressing in some other manner. Put the
fowl into a saucepan, stew all the ingredients,
and simmer gently for 1½ hour,
carefully skimming the broth well. When
done, strain, and put by in a cool place
until wanted; then take all the fat off
the top, warm up as much as may be
required, and serve. This broth is, of
course, only for those invalids whose
stomachs are strong enough to digest it,
with a flavouring of herbs, &amp;c. It may
be made in the same manner as beef tea,
with water and salt only, but the preparation
will be but tasteless and insipid.
When the invalid cannot digest this
chicken broth with the flavouring, we
would recommend plain beef tea in preference
to plain chicken tea, which it
would be without the addition of herbs,
onions, &amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Sufficient</i>
to make rather more than 1 pint of broth.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN, Curried.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast fowls, 2 large
onions, 1 apple, 2 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful
of curry-powder, 1 teaspoonful
of flour, ½ pint of gravy, 1 tablespoonful
of lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice the onions,
peel, core, and chop the apple, and cut
the fowl into neat joints; fry these in
the butter of a nice brown, then add the
curry-powder, flour, and gravy, and stew
for about 20 minutes. Put in the lemon-juice,
and serve with boiled rice, either
placed in a ridge round the dish or separately.
Two or three shalots or a little
garlic may be added, if approved. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the cold fowl, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
in the winter.</p>

taste of salt, white pepper, and cayenne;
2 blades of pounded mace, egg and bread-crumbs,
clarified butter, 1 strip of lemon-rind,
2 carrots, 1 onion, 2 tablespoonfuls
of mushroom ketchup, thickening of butter

the breast and leg-bones of the chickens;
cut the meat into neat pieces after having
skinned it, and season the cutlets with
pepper, salt, pounded mace, and cayenne.
Put the bones, trimmings, &amp;c., into a
stewpan with 1 pint of water, adding
carrots, onions, and lemon-peel in the
above proportion; stew gently for 1½
hour, and strain the gravy. Thicken it
with butter and flour, add the ketchup
and 1 egg well beaten; stir it over the
fire, and bring it to the simmering-point,
but do not allow it to boil. In the mean
time, egg and bread-crumb the cutlets,
and give them a few drops of clarified
butter; fry them a delicate brown, occasionally
turning them; arrange them
pyramidically on the dish, and pour over
them the sauce. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes to
fry the cutlets. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> each.
<i>Sufficient</i> for an entrée. <i>Seasonable</i> from
April to July.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN CUTLETS, French.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast or boiled
fowl, fried bread, clarified butter, the
yolk of 1 egg, bread-crumbs, ½ teaspoonful
of finely-minced lemon-peel; salt, cayenne,
and mace to taste. For sauce,—1
oz. of butter, 2 minced shalots, a few
slices of carrot, a small bunch of savoury
herbs, including parsley, 1 blade of
pounded mace, 6 peppercorns, ½ pint of
gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the fowls into as
many nice cutlets as possible; take a
corresponding number of sippets about
the same size, all cut one shape; fry
them a pale brown, put them before the
fire, then dip the cutlets into clarified
butter mixed with the yolk of an egg,
cover with bread-crumbs seasoned in
the above proportion, with lemon-peel,
mace, salt, and cayenne; fry them for
about 5 minutes, put each piece on one
of the sippets, pile them high in the dish,
and serve with the following sauce, which
should be made ready for the cutlets.
Put the butter into a stewpan, add the
shalots, carrot, herbs, mace, and peppercorns;
fry for 10 minutes, or rather
longer; pour in ½ pint of good gravy,
made of the chicken-bones; stew gently
for 20 minutes, strain it, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—5
minutes to fry the cutlets; 35 minutes
to make the gravy. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the chicken, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from

<h3>CHICKEN, Fricasseed (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 small fowls or 1 large
one, 3 oz. of butter, a bunch of parsley
and green onions, 1 clove, 2 blades of
mace, 1 shalot, 1 bay-leaf, salt and white
pepper to taste, ¼ pint of cream, the
yolks of 3 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose a couple
of fat plump chickens, and, after drawing,
singeing, and washing them, skin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
carve them into joints; blanch these in
boiling water for 2 or 3 minutes, take
them out, and immerse them in cold
water to render them white. Put the
trimmings, with the necks and legs, into
a stewpan; add the parsley, onions, clove,
mace, shalot, bay-leaf, and a seasoning
of pepper and salt; pour to these the
water that the chickens were blanched
in, and simmer gently for rather more
than 1 hour. Have ready another stewpan;
put in the joints of fowl, with the
above proportion of butter; dredge them
with flour, let them get hot, but do not
brown them much; then moisten the
fricassee with the gravy made from the
trimmings, &amp;c., and stew very gently for
½ hour. Lift the fowl into another stewpan,
skim the sauce, reduce it quickly
over the fire by letting it boil fast, and
strain it over them. Add the cream,
and a seasoning of pounded mace and
cayenne; let it boil up, and when ready
to serve, stir to it the well-beaten yolks
of 3 eggs; these should not be put in
till the last moment, and the sauce should
be made <i>hot</i>, but must <i>not boil</i>, or it will
instantly curdle. A few button-mushrooms
stewed with the fowl are by many
persons considered an improvement.
<i>Time.</i>—1 hour to make the gravy, ½ hour
to simmer the fowl. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>s.</i>
the pair. <i>Sufficient.</i>—1 large fowl for
1 entrée. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN (or Fowl) PATTIES.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast chicken or
fowl; to every ¼ lb. of meat allow 2 oz.
of ham, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls
of veal gravy, ½ teaspoonful
of minced lemon-peel; cayenne, salt,
and pepper to taste; 1 tablespoonful of
lemon-juice, 1 oz. of butter rolled in flour,
puff paste. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince very small
the white meat from a cold roast fowl,
after removing all the skin; weigh it,
and to every ¼ lb. of meat allow the above
proportion of minced ham. Put these
into a stewpan with the remaining ingredients,
stir over the fire for 10 minutes
or ¼ hour, taking care that the mixture
does not burn. Roll out some puff paste
about ¼ inch in thickness, line the patty-pans
with this, put upon each a small
piece of bread, and cover with another
layer of paste; brush over with the yolk
of an egg, and bake in a brisk oven for
about ¼ hour. When done, cut a round
piece out of the top, and, with a small
spoon, take out the bread (be particular
in not breaking the outside border of
the crust), and fill the patties with the
mixture. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour to prepare the
meat; not quite ¼ hour to bake the
crust. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN (or Fowl) PIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 small fowls or 1 large
one, white pepper and salt to taste, ½
teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, ½ teaspoonful
of pounded mace, forcemeat, a
few slices of ham, 3 hard-boiled eggs,
½ pint of water, puff crust. <i>Mode.</i>—Skin
and cut up the fowls into joints,
and put the neck, leg, and backbones
in a stewpan, with a little water, an
onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, and a
blade of mace; let these stew for about
an hour, and, when done, strain off the
liquor: this is for gravy, Put a layer
of fowl at the bottom of a pie-dish, then
a layer of ham, then one of forcemeat
and hard-boiled eggs cut in rings; between
the layers put a seasoning of
pounded mace, nutmeg, pepper, and salt.
Proceed in this manner until the dish is
full, and pour in about ½ pint of water;
border the edge of the dish with puff
crust, put on the cover, ornament the
top, and glaze it by brushing over it
the yolk of an egg. Bake from 1¼ to
1½ hour, should the pie be very large,
and, when done, pour in at the top the
gravy made from the bones. If to be
eaten cold, and wished particularly nice,
the joints of the fowls should be boned,
and placed in the dish with alternate
layers of forcemeat; sausage-meat may
also be substituted for the forcemeat,
and is now very much used. When the
chickens are boned, and mixed with
sausage-meat, the pie will take about
2 hours to bake. It should be covered
with a piece of paper when about half-done,
to prevent the paste being dried
up or scorched. <i>Time.</i>—For a pie with
unboned meat, 1¼ to 1½ hour; with boned
meat and sausage or forcemeat, 1½ to 2
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, with 2 fowls, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN, Potted (a Luncheon or
Breakfast Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold roast
chicken; to every lb. of meat allow ¼ lb.
of fresh butter, salt and cayenne to taste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
1 teaspoonful of pounded mace, ½ small
nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Strip the meat from
the bones of cold roast fowl; when it is
freed from gristle and skin, weigh it, and
to every lb. of meat allow the above proportion
of butter, seasoning, and spices.
Cut the meat into small pieces, pound it
well with the fresh butter, sprinkle in
the spices gradually, and keep pounding
until reduced to a perfectly smooth paste.
Put it into potting-pots for use, and cover
it with clarified butter, about ¼ inch in
thickness, and, if to be kept for some
time, tie over a bladder: 2 or 3 slices of
ham, minced and pounded with the above
ingredients, will be found an improvement.
It should be kept in a dry place.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CHICKEN (or Fowl) SALAD.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold roast
or boiled chicken, 2 lettuces, a little endive,
1 cucumber, a few slices of boiled
beetroot, salad-dressing. <i>Mode.</i>—Trim
neatly the remains of the chicken; wash,
dry, and slice the lettuces, and place in
the middle of a dish; put the pieces of
fowl on the top, and pour the salad-dressing
over them. Garnish the edge
of the salad with hard-boiled eggs cut in
rings, sliced cucumber, and boiled beetroot
cut in slices. Instead of cutting the
eggs in rings, the yolks may be rubbed
through a hair sieve, and the whites
chopped very finely, and arranged on the
salad in small bunches, yellow and white
alternately. This should not be made
long before it is wanted for table. <i>Average
cost</i>, exclusive of the cold chicken,

at any time.</p>


<h3>CHILI VINEGAR.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—50 fresh red English chilies,
1 pint of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Pound
or cut the chilies in half, and infuse them
in the vinegar for a fortnight, when it
will be fit for use. This will be found an
agreeable relish to fish, as many people
cannot eat it without the addition of an
acid and cayenne pepper.</p>


<h3>CHINA CHILO.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of leg, loin, or neck
of mutton, 2 onions, 2 lettuces, 1 pint of
green peas, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful
of pepper, ¼ pint of water, ¼ lb.
of clarified butter; when liked, a little
cayenne. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince the above quantity
of undressed leg, loin, or neck of
mutton, adding a little of the fat, also
minced; put it into a stewpan with the
remaining ingredients, previously shredding
the lettuce and onion rather fine;
closely cover the stewpan, after the ingredients
have been well stirred, and simmer
gently for rather more than two
hours. Serve in a dish, with a border of
rice round, the same as for curry. <i>Time.</i>—Rather
more than two hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4 persons.

<h3>CHOCOLATE, to Make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Allow ½ oz. of chocolate
to each person; to every oz. allow ½ pint
of water, ½ pint of milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
the milk-and-water hot;
scrape the chocolate into it, and
stir the mixture constantly and
quickly until the chocolate is dissolved;
bring it to the boiling-point,
stir it well, and serve directly
with white sugar. Chocolate
prepared within a mill, as
shown in the engraving, is made
by putting in the scraped chocolate,
pouring over it the boiling
milk-and-water, and milling it
over the fire until hot and frothy.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow ½ oz. of cake
chocolate to each person.</p>



<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 oz. of grated chocolate,
¼ lb. of sugar, 1½ pint of cream, 1½ oz. of
clarified isinglass, the yolks of 6 eggs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Beat the yolks of the eggs well,
put them into a basin with the grated
chocolate, the sugar, and 1 pint of the
cream; stir these ingredients well together,
pour them into a jug, and set this
jug in a saucepan of boiling water; stir
it one way until the mixture thickens,
but <i>do not allow it to boil</i>, or it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
curdle. Strain the cream through a sieve
into a basin; stir in the isinglass and the
other ½ pint of cream, which should be
well whipped; mix all well together, and
pour it into a mould which has been previously
oiled with the purest salad-oil,
and, if at hand, set it in ice until wanted
for table. <i>Time.</i>—About 10 minutes to
stir the mixture over the fire. <i>Average
cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, with cream at 1<i>s.</i> per pint.
<i>Sufficient</i> to fill a quart mould. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<h3>CHOCOLATE SOUFFLÉ.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, 3 teaspoonfuls of
pounded sugar, 1 teaspoonful of flour,
3 oz. of the best chocolate. <i>Mode.</i>—Break
the eggs, separating the whites
from the yolks, and put them into different
basins; add to the yolks the
sugar, flour, and chocolate, which should
be very finely grated, and stir these ingredients
for 5 minutes. Then well whisk
the whites of the eggs in the other basin
until they are stiff, and, when firm, mix
lightly with the yolks till the whole forms
a smooth and light substance; butter a
round cake-tin, put in the mixture, and
bake in a moderate oven from 15 to 20
minutes. Pin a white napkin round the
tin, strew sifted sugar over the top of the
soufflé, and send it immediately to table.
The proper appearance of this dish depends
entirely on the expedition with
which it is served; and some cooks, to
preserve its lightness, hold a salamander
over the soufflé until it is placed on the
table. If allowed to stand after it comes
from the oven it will be entirely spoiled,
as it falls almost immediately. <i>Time.</i>—15
to 20 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for a moderate-sized soufflé. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>CLARET-CUP.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 183px;">
<img src="images/illus-079.jpg" width="183" height="195" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">CLARET-CUP.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 bottle of claret, 1 bottle
of soda-water, about ½ lb. of pounded ice,
4 tablespoonfuls of
powdered sugar,
¼ teaspoonful of
grated nutmeg, 1
liqueur-glass of
Maraschino, a
sprig of green borage.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put
all the ingredients
into a silver cup,
regulating the proportion
of ice by
the state of the weather; if very warm,
a larger quantity would be necessary.
Hand the cup round with a clean napkin
passed through one of the handles,
that the edge of the cup may be
wiped after each guest has partaken
of the contents thereof. <i>Seasonable</i> in
summer.</p>


<h3>COCK-A-LEEKIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A capon or large fowl
(sometimes an old cock, from which the
recipe takes its name, is used), which
should be trussed as for boiling, 2 or 3
bunches of fine leeks, 5 quarts of stock
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#STOCKS">Stock</a></span>), pepper and salt to taste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Well wash the leeks (and, if old,
scald them in boiling water for a few
minutes), taking off the roots and part
of the heads, and cut them into lengths
of about an inch. Put the fowl into the
stock, with, at first, one half of the leeks,
and allow it to simmer gently. In half
an hour add the remaining leeks, and
then it may simmer for 3 or 4 hours
longer. It should be carefully skimmed,
and can be seasoned to taste. In serving,
take out the fowl and carve it neatly,
placing the pieces in a tureen, and pouring
over them the soup, which should be
very thick of leeks (a <i>purée</i> of leeks, the
French would call it). <i>Time.</i>—4 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per quart; or with
stock, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 10 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
in winter.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Without the fowl, the above,
which would then be merely called leek
soup, is very good, and also economical.
Cock-a-leekie was largely consumed at
the Burns Centenary Festival at the
Crystal Palace, Sydenham, in 1859.</p>


<h3>COCOA, to Make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Allow 2 teaspoonfuls of
the prepared cocoa to 1 breakfast-cup;
boiling milk and boiling water. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the cocoa into a breakfast-cup, pour
over it sufficient cold milk to make it
into a smooth paste; then add equal
quantities of boiling milk and boiling
water, and stir all well together. Care
must be taken not to allow the milk to
get burnt, as it will entirely spoil the
flavour of the preparation. The above
directions are usually given for making
the prepared cocoa. The rock cocoa, or
that bought in a solid piece, should be
scraped, and made in the same manner,
taking care to rub down all the lumps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
before the boiling liquid is added. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2
teaspoonfuls of prepared cocoa
for 1 breakfast-cup, or ¼ oz. of the rock
cocoa for the same quantity.</p>


<h3>COD.</h3>

<p>Cod should be chosen for the table
when it is plump and round near the tail,
when the hollow behind the head is deep,
and when the sides are undulated as if
they were ribbed. The glutinous parts
about the head lose their delicate flavour
after the fish has been twenty-four hours
out of the water. The great point by
which the cod should be judged is the
firmness of its flesh; and, although the
cod is not firm when it is alive, its quality
may be arrived at by pressing the finger
into the flesh: if this rises immediately,
the flesh is good; if not, it is stale.
Another sign of its goodness is, if the
fish, when it is cut, exhibits a bronze appearance,
like the silver side of a round of
beef; when this is the case the flesh will
be firm when cooked. Stiffness in a cod,
or in any other fish, is a sure sign of
freshness, though not always of quality.
Sometimes codfish, though exhibiting
signs of rough usage, will eat much better
than those with red gills, so strongly
recommended by many cookery-books.
This appearance is generally caused by
the fish having been knocked about at
sea, in the well-boats, in which they are
conveyed from the fishing-grounds to
market.</p>


<h3>COD à la BÉCHAMEL.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—Any

½ teaspoonful of powdered sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Chop the shalots, mince the ham
very fine, pour on the stock, and simmer
for 15 minutes. If the colour should not
be good, add cream in the above proportion,
and strain it through a fine
sieve; season it, and put in the vinegar,
lemon-juice, and sugar. Now boil the
cod, take out the middle bone, and skin
it; put it on the dish without breaking,
and pour the sauce over it. <i>Time.</i>—¾

<h3>COD PIE. (Economical.)</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—Any
remains of cold cod, 12 oysters,
sufficient melted butter to moisten it;
mashed potatoes enough to fill up the
dish. <i>Mode.</i>—Flake the fish from the
bone, and carefully take away all the
skin. Lay it in a pie-dish, pour over the
melted butter and oysters (or oyster
sauce, if there is any left), and cover
with mashed potatoes. Bake for ½ an
hour, and send to table of a nice brown
colour. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Seasonable</i> from
November to March.</p>


<h3>COD, Salt, commonly called “Salt-fish.”</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sufficient water to cover
the fish. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the fish, and
lay it all night in water, with a ¼ pint
of vinegar. When thoroughly soaked,
take it out, see that it is perfectly clean,
and put it in the fish-kettle with sufficient
cold water to cover it. Heat it
gradually, but do not let it boil much, or
the fish will be hard. Skim well, and
when done, drain the fish, and put it on
a napkin garnished with hard-boiled eggs
cut in rings. <i>Time.</i>—About 1 hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for
each person, ¼ lb. <i>Seasonable</i> in the
spring.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Serve with egg sauce and parsnips.
This is an especial dish on Ash
Wednesday.</p>


<h3>COD SOUNDS</h3>

<p>Should be well soaked in salt and
water, and thoroughly washed before
dressing them. They are considered a
great delicacy, and may either be broiled,
fried, or boiled; if they are boiled, mix
a little milk with the water.</p>


<h3>COD SOUNDS, en Poule.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—For forcemeat, 12 chopped
oysters, 3 chopped anchovies, ¼ lb.
of bread-crumbs, 1 oz. of butter, 2 eggs,
seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and
mace to taste; 4 cod sounds. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
the forcemeat by mixing the ingredients
well together. Wash the sounds,
and boil them in milk and water for ½ an
hour; take them out, and let them cool.
Cover each with a layer of forcemeat,
roll them up in a nice form, and skewer
them. Rub over with lard, dredge with
flour, and cook them gently before the
fire in a Dutch oven. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<h3>COD’S HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sufficient water to cover
the fish; 5 oz. of salt to each gallon of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse the fish thoroughly,
and rub a little salt over the
thick part and inside of the fish 1 or 2
hours before dressing it, as this very
much improves the flavour. Lay it in
the fish-kettle, with sufficient cold water
to cover it. Be very particular not to
pour the water on the fish, as it is liable
to break it, and only keep it just simmering.
If the water should boil away, add
a little by pouring it in at the side of
the kettle, and not on the fish. Add
salt in the above proportion, and bring
it gradually to a boil. Skim very carefully,
draw it to the side of the fire, and
let it gently simmer till done. Take it
out and drain it; serve on a hot napkin,
and garnish with cut lemon and horseradish.
<i>Time.</i>—According to size, ½ an
hour, more or less. <i>Average cost</i>, from
3<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 8 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from November to March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Oyster sauce and plain melted
butter should be served with this.</p>


<h3>COD’S HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS,
to Carve.</h3>

<p>First run the knife along the centre of
the side of the fish, namely, from <i>d</i> to <i>b</i>,
down to the bone; then carve it in unbroken
slices downwards from <i>d</i> to <i>e</i>, or
upwards from <i>d</i> to <i>c</i>, as shown in the
engraving. The carver should ask the
guests if they would like a portion of the
roe and liver.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/illus-082.jpg" width="358" height="188" alt="diagram of fish head and start of body" />
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Of this fish, the parts about the
backbone and shoulders are the firmest
and most esteemed by connoisseurs. The
sound, which lines the fish beneath the
backbone, is considered a delicacy, as
are also the gelatinous parts about the
head and neck.</p>


<h3>COFFEE, Essence of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every ¼ lb. of ground
coffee allow 1 small teaspoonful of powdered
chicory, 3 small teacupfuls, or
1 pint, of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the coffee
be freshly ground, and, if possible, freshly
roasted; put it into a percolater, or filter,
with the chicory, and pour <i>slowly</i> over it
the above proportion of boiling water.
When it has all filtered through, warm
the coffee sufficiently to bring it to the
simmering-point, but do not allow it to
boil; then filter it a second time, put it
into a clean and dry bottle, cork it well,
and it will remain good for several days.
Two tablespoonfuls of this essence are
quite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful of
hot milk. This essence will be found
particularly useful to those persons who
have to rise extremely early; and having
only the milk to make boiling, is very
easily and quickly prepared. When the
essence is bottled, pour another 3 teacupfuls
of <i>boiling</i> water slowly on the
grounds, which, when filtered through,
will be a very weak coffee. The next
time there is essence to be prepared,
make this weak coffee boiling, and pour
it on the ground coffee instead of plain
water: by this means a better coffee
will be obtained. Never throw away the
grounds without having made use of them
in this manner; and always cork the
bottle well that contains this preparation,
until the day that it is wanted for
making the fresh essence. <i>Time.</i>—To
be filtered once, then brought to the
boiling-point, and filtered again. <i>Average
cost</i>, with coffee at 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per lb., 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 2 tablespoonfuls for a
breakfast-cupful of hot milk.</p>


<h3>COFFEE, Nutritious.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ oz. of ground coffee, 1
pint of milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the coffee be
freshly ground; put it into a saucepan
with the milk, which should be made
nearly boiling before the coffee is put in,
and boil together for 3 minutes; clear it
by pouring some of it into a cup, and
then back again, and leave it on the hob
for a few minutes to settle thoroughly.
This coffee may be made still more nutritious
by the addition of an egg well
beaten, and put into the coffee-cup.
<i>Time.</i>—5 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to
settle. <i>Sufficient</i> to make 1 large breakfast-cupful
of coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>


<h3>COFFEE, Simple Method of
Making.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Allow ½ oz., or 1 tablespoonful,
of coffee to each person; to
every oz. allow ½ pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Have
a small iron ring made to fit the
top of the coffee-pot inside, and to this
ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin
for the purpose must not be too thin).
Fit the bag into the pot, warm the pot
with some boiling water; throw this
away, and put the ground coffee into the
bag; pour over as much boiling water as
is required, close the lid, and, when all
the water has filtered through, remove
the bag, and send the coffee to table.
Making it in this manner prevents the
necessity of pouring the coffee from one
vessel to another, which cools and spoils
it. The water should be poured on the
coffee gradually, so that the infusion
may be stronger; and the bag must be
well made, that none of the grounds may
escape through the seams, and so make
the coffee thick and muddy. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
1 tablespoonful, or ½ oz., to each
person.</p>

<div class="caption">LOYSEL’S HYDROSTATIC URN.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Allow ½ oz., or 1 tablespoonful,
of ground coffee to each person;
to every oz. of coffee allow 1/3 pint
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—To make coffee good,
<i>it should never be boiled</i>, but the boiling
water merely poured on it, the same as
for tea. The coffee should always be
purchased in the berry,—if possible,
freshly roasted; and it should never be
ground long before it is wanted for use.
There are very many new kinds of coffee-pots,
but the method of making the
coffee is nearly always the same, namely,
pouring the boiling water on the powder,
and allowing it to filter through. Our
illustration shows one of Loysel’s Hydrostatic
Urns, which are admirably adapted
for making good and clear coffee, which
should be made in the following manner:—Warm
the urn with boiling water,
remove the lid and movable filter, and
place the ground coffee at the bottom of
the urn. Put the movable filter over
this, and screw the lid, inverted, tightly
on the end of the centre pipe. Pour into
the inverted lid the above proportion of
boiling water, and when all the water so
poured has disappeared from the funnel,
and made its way down the centre pipe
and up again through the ground coffee
by <i>hydrostatic pressure</i>, unscrew the lid
and cover the urn. Pour back direct
into the urn, <i>not through the funnel</i>, one,
two, or three cups, according to the size
of the percolater, in order to make the
infusion of uniform strength; the contents
will then be ready for use, and
should run from the tap strong, hot, and
clear. The coffee made in these urns
generally turns out very good, and there
is but one objection to them,—the coffee
runs rather slowly from the tap; this is
of no consequence where there is a small
party, but tedious where there are many
persons to provide for. A remedy for
this objection may be suggested, namely,
to make the coffee very strong, so that
not more than 1/3 cup would be required,
as the rest would be filled up with milk.
Making coffee in filters or percolaters
does away with the necessity of using
isinglass, white of egg, and various other
preparations, to clear it. Coffee should
always be served very hot, and, if possible,
in the same vessel in which it is
made, as pouring it from one pot to
another cools, and consequently spoils
it. Many persons may think that the
proportion of water we have given for
each oz. of coffee is rather small; it is
so, and the coffee produced from it will
be very strong; 1/3 of a cup will be found
quite sufficient, which should be filled
with nice hot milk, or milk and cream
mixed. This is the <i>café au lait</i> for which
our neighbours over the Channel are so
justly celebrated. Should the ordinary
method of making coffee be preferred,
use double the quantity of water, and,
in pouring it into the cups, put in more
coffee and less milk. <i>Sufficient.</i>—For
very good coffee, allow ½ oz., or 1 tablespoonful,
to each person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>


<h3>COFFEE, to Roast. (A French
Recipe.)</h3>

<p>It being an acknowledged fact that
French coffee is decidedly superior to
that made in England, and as the roasting
of the berry is of great importance
to the flavour of the preparation, it will
be useful and interesting to know how
they manage these things in France. In
Paris, there are two houses justly celebrated
for the flavour of their coffee,—<i>La
Maison Corcellet</i> and <i>La Maison
Royer de Chartres</i>; and to obtain this
flavour before roasting, they add to every
3 lbs. of coffee a piece of butter the size
of a nut, and a dessertspoonful of powdered
sugar: it is then roasted in the
usual manner. The addition of the butter
and sugar develops the flavour and
aroma of the berry; but it must be borne
in mind, that the quality of the butter
must be of the very best description.</p>


<h3>COLLOPS, Scotch.</h3>

<h3>COLLOPS, Scotch, White.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast veal, ½ teaspoonful
of grated nutmeg, 2 blades of
pounded mace, cayenne and salt to taste,
a little butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour,
¼ pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy

them in a little butter. Dish them, and
make a gravy in the pan by putting in
the remaining ingredients. Give one
boil, and pour it over the collops; garnish
with lemon and slices of toasted
bacon, rolled. Forcemeat balls may be
added to this dish. If cream is not at
hand, substitute the yolk of an egg beaten
up well with a little milk. <i>Time.</i>—About
5 or 7 minutes. <i>Seasonable</i> from May to
October.</p>


<h3>COMPÔTE.</h3>

<p>A confiture made at the moment of
need, and with much less sugar than
would be ordinarily put to preserves.
They are very wholesome things, suitable
to most stomachs which cannot accommodate
themselves to raw fruit or a
large portion of sugar: they are the
happy medium, and far better than ordinary
stewed fruit. For Fruit Compôtes
refer to the recipes relating to the various
Fruits.</p>


<h3>CONFECTIONARY.</h3>

<p>In speaking of confectionary, it should
be remarked that many preparations
come under that head; for the various
fruits, flowers, herbs, roots, and juices,
which, when boiled with sugar, were formerly
employed in pharmacy as well as
for sweetmeats, were called <i>confections</i>,
from the Latin word <i>conficere</i>, ‘to make
up;’ but the term confectionary embraces
a very large class indeed of sweet food,
many kinds of which should not be attempted
in the ordinary cuisine. The
thousand and one ornamental dishes that
adorn the tables of the wealthy should
be purchased from the confectioner: they
cannot profitably be made at home.
Apart from these, cakes, biscuits, and
tarts, &amp;c., the class of sweetmeats called
confections may be thus classified:—1.
Liquid confects, or fruits either whole
or in pieces, preserved by being immersed
in a fluid transparent syrup; as
the liquid confects of apricots, green
citrons, and many foreign fruits. 2. Dry
confects are those which, after having
been boiled in the syrup, are taken out
and put to dry in an oven, as citron and
orange-peel, &amp;c. 3. Marmalade, jams,
and pastes, a kind of soft compounds
made of the pulp of fruits or other vegetable
substances, beat up with sugar or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
honey; such as oranges, apricots, pears,
&amp;c. 4. Jellies are the juices of fruits
boiled with sugar to a pretty thick consistency,
so as, upon cooling, to form a
trembling jelly; as currant, gooseberry,
apple jelly, &amp;c. 5. Conserves are a kind
of dry confects, made by beating up
flowers, fruits, &amp;c., with sugar, not dissolved.
6. Candies are fruits candied
over with sugar after having been boiled
in the syrup.</p>


<h3>COW-HEEL, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Ox-feet, the yolk of 1
egg, bread-crumbs, parsley, salt and
cayenne to taste, boiling butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash,
scald, and thoroughly clean the
feet, and cut them into pieces about
2 inches long; have ready some fine
bread-crumbs mixed with a little minced
parsley, cayenne, and salt; dip the
pieces of heel into the yolk of egg,
sprinkle them with the bread-crumbs,
and fry them until of a nice brown in
boiling butter. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Ox-feet maybe dressed in various
ways, stewed in gravy or plainly
boiled and served with melted butter.
When plainly boiled, the liquor will answer
for making sweet or relishing jellies,
and also to give richness to soups
or gravies.</p>


<h3>COW-HEEL STOCK, for Jellies
(More Economical than Calf’s-Feet).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 cow-heels, 3 quarts of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Procure 2 heels that
have only been scalded, and not boiled;
split them in two, and remove the fat
between the claws; wash them well in
warm water, and put them into a saucepan
with the above proportion of cold
water; bring it gradually to boil, remove
all the scum as it rises, and simmer
the heels gently from 7 to 8 hours, or
until the liquor is reduced one-half; then
strain it into a basin, measuring the quantity,
and put it in a cool place. Clarify
it in the same manner as calf’s-feet stock,
using, with the other ingredients, about
½ oz. of isinglass to each quart. This
stock should be made the day before it
is required for use. Two dozen shank-bones
of mutton, boiled for 6 or 7 hours,
yield a quart of strong firm stock. They
should be put on in 2 quarts of water,
which should be reduced one-half. Make
this also the day before it is required.
<i>Time.</i>—7 to 8 hours to boil the cow-heels,
6 to 7 hours to boil the shank-bones.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 4<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2
cow-heels should make 3 pints
of stock. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>COWSLIP WINE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every gallon of water
allow 3 lbs. of lump sugar, the rind of
2 lemons, the juice of 1, the rind and
juice of 1 Seville orange, 1 gallon of cowslip
pips. To every 4½ gallons of wine
allow 1 bottle of brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the sugar and water together for ½ hour,
carefully removing all the scum as it
rises. Pour this boiling liquor on the
orange and lemon-rinds and the juice,
which should be strained; when milk-warm,
add the cowslip pips or flowers,
picked from the stalks and seeds; and
to 9 gallons of wine 3 tablespoonfuls of
good fresh brewers’ yeast. Let it ferment
3 or 4 days, then put all together
in a cask with the brandy, and let it
remain for 2 months, when bottle it off
for use. <i>Time.</i>—To be boiled ½ hour;
to ferment 3 or 4 days; to remain in the
cask 2 months. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the cowslips, which may be picked in
the fields, 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per gallon. <i>Seasonable.</i>
Make this in April or May.</p>


<h3>CRAB, to Choose.</h3>

<p>The middle-sized crab is the best; and
the crab, like the lobster, should be
judged by its weight; for if light, it is
watery.</p>


<h3>CRAB, to Dress.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 crab, 2 tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, 1 ditto of oil; salt, white
pepper, and cayenne, to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Empty

crab, pick the meat out from the shells,
and mix with it the nutmeg and seasoning.
Cut up the butter in small pieces,
and add the bread-crumbs and vinegar.
Mix altogether, put the whole in the large
shell, and brown before the fire or with
a salamander. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 10<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 persons,
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year; but not
so good in May, June, and July.</p>


<h3>CRAB SAUCE, for Fish (equal to
Lobster Sauce).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 crab; salt, pounded
mace, and cayenne to taste; ½ pint of
melted butter made with milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose
a nice fresh crab, pick all the
meat away from the shell, and cut it into
small square pieces. Make ½ pint of
melted butter, put in the fish and seasoning;
let it gradually warm through,
and simmer for 2 minutes: it should not
boil. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>CRAYFISH.</h3>

<p>Crayfish should be thrown into boiling
water, to which has been added a good
seasoning of salt and a little vinegar.
When done, which will be in ¼ hour,
take them out and drain them. Let
them cool, arrange them on a napkin,
and garnish with plenty of double parsley.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This fish is frequently used for
garnishing boiled turkey, boiled fowl,
calf’s head, turbot, and all kinds of boiled
fish.</p>


<h3>CRAYFISH, Potted.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—100 crayfish; pounded
mace, pepper, and salt to taste; 2 oz.
butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the fish in salt and
water, pick out all the meat, and pound
it in a mortar to a paste. Whilst pounding,
add the butter gradually, and mix
in the spice and seasoning. Put it in
small pots, and pour over it clarified
butter, carefully excluding the air. <i>Time.</i>—15
minutes to boil the crayfish. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>


<h3>CRAYFISH SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—50 crayfish, ¼ lb. of butter,
6 anchovies, the crumb of 1 French
roll, a little lobster-spawn, seasoning to
taste, 2 quarts of medium stock, or fish
stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Shell the crayfish, and
put the fish between two plates until they
are wanted; pound the shells in a mortar
with the butter and anchovies; when
well beaten, add a pint of stock, and
simmer for ¾ of an hour. Strain it through
a hair sieve, put the remainder of the
stock to it, with the crumb of the roll;
give it one boil, and rub it through a
tammy, with the lobster-spawn. Put in
the fish, but do not let the soup boil
after it has been rubbed through the
tammy. If necessary, add seasoning.
<i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> or
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.

<h3>CREAM à la VALOIS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 sponge-cakes, jam, ¾
pint of cream, sugar to taste, the juice
of ½ lemon, ¼ glass of sherry, 1¼ oz. of
isinglass. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the sponge-cakes
into thin slices, place two together with
preserve between them, and pour over
them a small quantity of sherry mixed
with a little brandy. Sweeten and flavour
the cream with the lemon-juice and
sherry; add the isinglass, which should
be dissolved in a little water, and beat
up the cream well. Place a little in an
oiled mould; arrange the pieces of cake
in the cream, then fill the mould with
the remainder, let it cool, and turn it out
on a dish. By oiling the mould the
cream will have a much smoother appearance,
and will turn out more easily than
when merely dipped in cold water. <i>Average
cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill a 1½ pint
mould. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CREAM CHEESE.</h3>

<p>Cream cheese should be served on a
d’oyley, and garnished either with water-cresses
or parsley; of the former, a plentiful
supply should be given, as they add
greatly to the appearance of the dish,
besides improving the flavour of the
cheese.</p>


<h3>CREAM, Devonshire.</h3>

<p>The milk should stand 24 hours in the
winter, half that time when the weather
is very warm. The milkpan is then set
on a stove, and should there remain until
the milk is quite hot; but it must not
boil, or there will be a thick skin on the
surface. When it is sufficiently done
the undulations on the surface look thick,
and small rings appear. The time required
for scalding cream depends on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the size of the pan and the heat of the
fire, but the slower it is done the better.
The pan should be placed in the dairy
when the cream is sufficiently scalded,
and skimmed the following day. This
cream is so much esteemed that it is sent
to the London markets in small square
tins, and is exceedingly delicious eaten
with fresh fruit. In Devonshire, butter
is made from this cream, and is usually
very firm.</p>


<h3>CREAM, Italian.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of milk, ½ pint of
cream, sugar to taste, 1 oz. of isinglass,
1 lemon, the yolks of 4 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the cream and milk into a saucepan,
with sugar to sweeten, and the lemon-rind.
Boil until the milk is well flavoured,
then strain it into a basin and
add the beaten yolks of eggs. Put this
mixture into a jug, place the jug in a
saucepan of boiling water over the fire,
and stir the contents until they thicken,
but do not allow them to boil. Take the
cream off the fire, stir in the lemon-juice
and isinglass, which should be melted,
and whip well; fill a mould, place it in
ice if at hand, and, when set, turn it out
on a dish, and garnish as taste may dictate.
The mixture may be whipped and
drained, and then put into small glasses,
when this mode of serving is preferred.
<i>Time.</i>—From 5 to 8 minutes to stir the
mixture in the jug. <i>Average cost</i>, with
the best isinglass, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to
fill 1½ pint mould. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>CREAM SAUCE, for Fish or White
Dishes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1/3 pint of cream, 2 oz. of
butter, 1 teaspoonful of flour, salt and
cayenne to taste; when liked, a small
quantity of pounded mace or lemon-juice.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the butter in a very clean
saucepan, dredge in the flour, and keep
shaking round till the butter is melted.
Add the seasoning and cream, and stir
the whole till it boils; let it just simmer
for 5 minutes, when add either pounded
mace or lemon-juice to taste to give it a
flavour. <i>Time.</i>—5 minutes to simmer.
<i>Average cost</i> for this quantity, 7<i>d.</i></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This sauce may be flavoured
with very finely-shredded shalot.</p>


<h3>CREAM, Stone, of tous les Mois.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of preserve, 1 pint
of milk, 2 oz. of lump sugar, 1 heaped
tablespoonful of tous les mois, 3 drops of
essence of cloves, 3 drops of almond-flavouring.
<i>Mode.</i>—Place the preserve
at the bottom of a glass dish; put the
milk into a lined saucepan, with the
sugar, and make it boil. Mix to a smooth
batter the tous les mois with a very little
cold milk; stir it briskly into the boiling
milk, add the flavouring, and simmer
for 2 minutes. When rather cool, but
before turning solid, pour the cream over
the jam, and ornament it with strips of
red-currant jelly or preserved fruit. <i>Time.</i>—2
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>CREAM, Swiss.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of macaroons or 6
small sponge-cakes, sherry, 1 pint of
cream, 5 oz. of lump sugar, 2 large tablespoonfuls
of arrowroot, the rind of 1
lemon, the juice of ½ lemon, 3 tablespoonfuls
of milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Lay the macaroons
or sponge-cakes in a glass dish,
and pour over them as much sherry as
will cover them, or sufficient to soak them
well. Put the cream into a lined saucepan,
with the sugar and lemon-rind, and
let it remain by the side of the fire until
the cream is well flavoured, when take
out the lemon-rind. Mix the arrowroot
smoothly with the cold milk; add this to
the cream, and let it boil gently for about
3 minutes, keeping it well stirred. Take
it off the fire, stir till nearly cold, when
add the lemon-juice, and pour the whole
over the cakes. Garnish the cream with
strips of angelica, or candied citron cut
thin, or bright-coloured jelly or preserve.
This cream is exceedingly delicious, flavoured
with vanilla instead of lemon:
when this flavouring is used the sherry
may be omitted, and the mixture poured
over the <i>dry</i> cakes. <i>Time.</i>—About ½ hour
to infuse the lemon-rind; 5 minutes to
boil the cream. <i>Average cost</i>, with cream
at 1<i>s.</i> per pint, 3<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CREAM, Vanilla.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/illus-088a.jpg" width="245" height="214" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">VANILLA-CREAM MOULD.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of milk, the yolks
of 8 eggs, 6 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of isinglass,
flavouring to taste of essence of vanilla.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk and sugar into a
saucepan, and let it get hot over a slow
fire; beat up the yolks of the eggs, to
which add gradually the sweetened milk;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
flavour the whole with essence of vanilla,
put the mixture into a jug, and place this
jug in a saucepan of boiling water. Stir
the contents with a wooden spoon one
way until the mixture thickens, but do
not allow
it to boil,
or it will
be full
of lumps.
Take it off
the fire;
stir in the
isinglass,
which
should be
previously
dissolved
in about ¼ pint of water, and boiled for
2 or 3 minutes; pour the cream into an
oiled mould, put it in a cool place to set,
and turn it out carefully on a dish. Instead
of using the essence of vanilla, a
pod may be boiled in the milk until
the flavour is well extracted. A pod,
or a pod and a half, will be found sufficient
for the above proportion of ingredients.
<i>Time.</i>—About 10 minutes to
stir the mixture. <i>Average cost</i>, with the
best isinglass, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill a
quart mould. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CREAM, Whipped, for putting on
Trifles, serving in Glasses, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every pint of cream
allow 3 oz. of pounded sugar, 1 glass of
sherry or any kind of sweet white wine,
the rind of ½ lemon, the white of 1 egg.
<i>Mode.</i>—Rub the sugar on the lemon-rind,
and pound it in a mortar until
quite fine, and beat up the white of the
egg until quite stiff; put the cream into
a large bowl, with the sugar, wine, and
beaten egg, and whip it to a froth; as
fast as the froth rises take it off with a
skimmer, and put it on a sieve to drain
in a cool place. This should be made the
day before it is wanted, as the whip is
then so much firmer. The cream should
be whipped in a cool place, and in summer
over ice, if it is obtainable. A plain
whipped cream may be served on a glass
dish, and garnished with strips of angelica,
or pastry-leaves, or pieces of bright-coloured
jelly: it makes a very pretty
addition to the supper-table. <i>Time.</i>—About
1 hour to whip the cream. <i>Average
cost</i>, with cream at 1<i>s.</i> per pint, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 1 dish or 1 trifle. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<h3>CRUMPETS.</h3>

<p>These are made in the same manner as
muffins, only, in making the mixture,
let it be more like batter than dough.
Let it rise for about ½ hour; pour it into
iron rings, which should be ready on a
hot-plate; bake them, and when one side
appears done, turn them quickly on the
other. <i>To toast them</i>, have ready a very
<i>bright clear</i> fire; put the crumpet on a
toasting-fork, and hold it before the fire,
<i>not too close</i>, until it is nicely brown on
one side, but do not allow it to blacken;
turn it, and brown the other side; then
spread it with good butter, cut it in half,
and, when all are done, pile them on a
hot dish, and send them quickly to table.
Muffins and crumpets should always be
served on separate dishes, and both
toasted and served as expeditiously as
possible. <i>Time.</i>—From 10 to 15 minutes
to bake them. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 2 crumpets
to each person.</p>


<h3>CRUST, Butter, for Boiled Puddings.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour allow
6 oz. of butter, ½ pint of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—With a knife, work the flour to
a smooth paste with ½ pint of water; roll
the crust out rather thin; place the
butter over it in small pieces, dredge
lightly over it some flour, and fold the
paste over; repeat the rolling once more,
and the crust will be ready for use. It
may be enriched by adding another
2 oz. of butter; but, for ordinary purposes,
the above quantity will be found
quite sufficient. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3>CRUST, Common, for Raised Pies.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour allow
½ pint of water, 1½ oz. of butter,
1½ oz. of lard, ½ saltspoonful of salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put into a saucepan the water;
when it boils, add the butter and lard,
and when these are melted, make a hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
in the middle of the flour; pour in the
water gradually, beat it well with a
wooden spoon, and be particular in not
making the paste too soft. When it is
well mixed, knead it with the hands
until quite stiff, dredging a little flour
over the paste and board to prevent them
from sticking. When it is well kneaded,
place it before the fire, with a cloth
covered over it, for a few minutes; it will
then be more easily worked into shape.
This paste does not taste so nicely as
a richer one, but it is worked with
greater facility, and answers just as well
for raised pies, for the crust is seldom
eaten. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3>CRUST, Dripping, for Kitchen Puddings,
Pies, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour allow
6 oz. of clarified beef dripping, ½ pint
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—After having clarified
the dripping, weigh it, and to every lb.
of flour allow the above proportion of
dripping. With a knife, work the flour
into a smooth paste with the water, rolling
it out three times, each time placing
on the crust 2 oz. of the dripping broken
into small pieces. If this paste is lightly
made, if good dripping is used, and <i>not
too much of it</i>, it will be found good; and
by the addition of two tablespoonfuls of
fine moist sugar, it may be converted
into a common short crust for fruit pies.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3>CRUST, Lard or Flead.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour allow
½ lb. of lard or flead, ½ pint of water,
½ saltspoonful of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Clear the
flead from skin, and slice it into thin
flakes; rub it into the flour, add the
salt, and work the whole into a smooth
paste, with the above proportion of
water; fold the paste over two or three
times, beat it well with the rolling-pin,
roll it out, and it will be ready for use.
The crust made from this will be found
extremely light, and may be made into
cakes or tarts; it may also be very much
enriched by adding more flead to the
same proportion of flour. <i>Average cost</i>,
8<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3>CRUST, Suet, for Pies or Puddings.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour allow
5 or 6 oz. of beef suet, ½ pint of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Free the suet from skin and
shreds, chop it extremely fine, and rub
it well into the flour; work the whole
to a smooth paste with the above proportion
of water; roll it out, and it is ready
for use. This crust is quite rich enough
for ordinary purposes, but when a better
one is desired, use from ½ to ¾ lb. of suet
to every lb. of flour. Some cooks, for
rich crusts, pound the suet in a mortar,
with a small quantity of butter. It should
then be laid on the paste in small pieces,
the same as for puff-crust, and will be
found exceedingly nice for hot tarts.
5 oz. of suet to every lb. of flour will
make a very good crust; and even ¼ lb,
will answer very well for children, or
where the crust is wanted very plain.
<i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3>CRUST, Common Short.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour allow
2 oz. of sifted sugar, 3 oz. of butter,
about ½ pint of boiling milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Crumble
the butter into the flour as
finely as possible, add the sugar, and
work the whole up to a smooth paste
with the boiling milk. Roll it out thin,
and bake in a moderate oven. <i>Average
cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3><a id="CRUST_Very_good_Short_for_Fruit_Tarts"></a>CRUST, Very good Short for Fruit
Tarts.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour allow
½ or ¾ lb. of butter, 1 tablespoonful of
sifted sugar, 1/3 pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub
the butter into the flour, after having
ascertained that the latter is perfectly
dry; add the sugar, and mix the whole
into a stiff paste with about 1/3 pint of
water. Roll it out two or three times,
folding the paste over each time, and it
will be ready for use. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>
per lb.</p>


<h3>CRUST, Another good Short.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour allow
8 oz. of butter, the yolks of 2 eggs,
2 oz. of sifted sugar, about ¼ pint of milk.
<i>Mode.</i>—Rub the butter into the flour, add
the sugar, and mix the whole as lightly
as possible to a smooth paste, with the
yolks of the eggs well beaten, and the
milk. The proportion of the latter ingredient
must be judged of by the size
of the eggs; if these are large so much
will not be required, and more if the
eggs are smaller. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per lb.</p>

<h3>CUCUMBER SAUCE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 or 4 cucumbers, 2 oz.
of butter, 6 tablespoonfuls of brown
gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel the cucumbers,
quarter them, and take out the seeds;
cut them into small pieces, put them in
a cloth, and rub them well to take out
the water that hangs about them. Put
the butter in a saucepan, add the cucumbers,
and shake them over a sharp
fire until they are of a good colour; then
pour over them the gravy, mixed with the
cucumbers, and simmer gently for 10
minutes, when it will be ready to serve.

cucumbers are tender, which will be in
about ¼ hour. Then add the yolks of the
eggs, well beaten; stir them to the sauce,
but do not allow it to boil, and serve very
hot. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ½ hour.</p>


<h3>CUCUMBER SOUP (French Recipe).</h3>

thin slices, put these on a plate with a
little salt, to draw the water from them;
drain, and put them in your stewpan
with the butter. When they are warmed
through, without being browned, pour
the stock on them. Add the sorrel, chervil,
and seasoning, and boil for 40 minutes.
Mix the well-beaten yolks of the
eggs with the cream, which add at the
moment of serving. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from June to
September.</p>


<h3>CUCUMBER VINEGAR (a very
nice addition to Salads).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—10 large cucumbers, or
12 smaller ones, 1 quart of vinegar, 2
onions, 2 shalots, 1 tablespoonful of salt,
2 tablespoonfuls of pepper, ¼ teaspoonful
of cayenne. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare and slice the
cucumbers, put them in a stone jar or
wide-mouthed bottle with the vinegar;
slice the onions and shalots, and add
them, with all the other ingredients, to
the cucumbers. Let it stand 4 or 5 days,
boil it all up, and, when cold, strain the
liquor through a piece of muslin, and
store it away in small bottles well sealed.
This vinegar is a very nice addition to
gravies, hashes, &amp;c., as well as a great
improvement to salads, or to eat with
cold meat.</p>

<h3>CUCUMBERS, to Dress.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil,
4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and
pepper to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare the cucumber,
cut it equally into <i>very thin</i>
slices, and <i>commence</i> cutting from the
<i>thick end;</i> if commenced at the stalk,
the cucumber will most likely have an
exceedingly bitter taste, far from agreeable.
For the purpose of slicing cucumbers
evenly and very thin, we recommend
the slice in preference to an ordinary
knife. Put the slices into a dish, sprinkle
over salt and
pepper, and
pour over oil
and vinegar in
the above proportion;
turn
the cucumber about, and it is ready to
serve. This is a favourite accompaniment
to boiled salmon, is a nice addition
to all descriptions of salads, and makes
a pretty garnish to lobster salad. <i>Average
cost</i>, when scarce, 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
when cheapest, may be had for 1<i>d.</i> each.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Forced from the beginning
of March to the end of June; in full season
in July, August, and September.</p>

<h3>CUCUMBERS, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 or 3 cucumbers, pepper
and salt to taste, flour, oil or butter.
<i>Mode.</i>—Pare the cucumbers, and cut
them into slices of an equal thickness,
commencing to slice from the thick and
not the stalk end of the cucumber. Wipe
the slices dry with a cloth, dredge them
with flour, and put them into a pan of
boiling oil or butter; keep turning them
about until brown; lift them out of the
pan, let them drain, and serve, piled
lightly in a dish. These will be found a
great improvement to rump-steak: they
should be placed on a dish with the steak
on the top. <i>Time.</i>—5 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, when cheapest, 1<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Forced
from the beginning of March to the end
of June; in full season in July and
August.</p>


<h3>CUCUMBERS à la Poulette.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 or 3 cucumbers, salt
and vinegar, 2 oz. of butter, flour, ½ pint
of broth, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley,
a lump of sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, salt
and pepper to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare and
cut the cucumbers into slices of an equal
thickness, and let them remain in a pickle
of salt and vinegar for ½ hour, then drain
them in a cloth, and put them into a
stewpan with the butter. Fry them over
a brisk fire, but do not brown them, and
then dredge over them a little flour; add
the broth, skim off all the fat, which will
rise to the surface, and boil gently until
the gravy is somewhat reduced, but the
cucumber should not be broken. Stir in
the yolks of the eggs, add the parsley,
sugar, and a seasoning of pepper and
salt; bring the whole to the <i>point of
boiling</i>, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>, when cheapest, 1<i>d.</i>
each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
in July, August, or September;
but may be had, forced, from the beginning
of March.</p>


<h3>CUCUMBERS, Pickled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 oz. of whole pepper,
1 oz. of bruised ginger, sufficient vinegar
to cover the cucumbers. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the
cucumbers in thick slices, sprinkle salt
over them, and let them remain for 24
hours. The next day, drain them well
for 6 hours, put them into a jar, pour
boiling vinegar over them, and keep them
in a warm place. In a short time, boil
up the vinegar again, add pepper and
ginger in the above proportion, and instantly
cover them up. Tie them down
with bladder, and in a few days they will
be fit for use.</p>


<h3>CUCUMBERS, an excellent way of
Preserving.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Salt and water, 1 lb. of
lump sugar, the rind of 1 lemon, 1 oz. of
ginger, cucumbers. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose the
greenest cucumbers, and those that are
most free from seeds; put them in strong
salt and water, with a cabbage-leaf to
keep them down; tie a paper over them,
and put them in a warm place till they
are yellow, then wash them and set them
over the fire in fresh water with a very
little salt, and another cabbage-leaf over
them; cover very closely, but take care
they do not boil. If they are not a fine
green, change the water again, cover
them as before, and make them hot.
When they are a good colour take them
off the fire and let them cool; cut them
in quarters, take out the seeds and pulp,
and put them into cold water; let them
remain for 2 days, changing the water
twice each day, to draw out the salt. Put
the sugar, with ½ pint of water, in a
saucepan over the fire; remove the scum
as it rises, and add the lemon-peel and
ginger with the outside scraped off; when
the syrup is tolerably thick, take it off
the fire, and when <i>cold</i>, wipe the cucumbers
<i>dry</i> and put them in. Boil the
syrup once in 2 or 3 days for 3 weeks;
strengthen it if required, and let it be
quite cold before the cucumbers are put
in. Great attention must be paid to the
directions in the commencement of this
recipe, as, if these are not properly carried
out, the result will be far from satisfactory.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—This recipe should
be used in June, July, or August.</p>


<h3>CUCUMBERS, German Method of
keeping for Winter use.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Cucumbers, salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare
and slice the cucumbers (as for
the table), sprinkle well with salt, and
let them remain for 24 hours; strain off
the liquor, pack in jars, a thick layer
of cucumbers and salt alternately; tie
down closely, and, when wanted for use,
take out the quantity required. Now
wash them well in fresh water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
dress as usual with pepper, vinegar, and
oil.</p>


<h3>CUCUMBERS, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 large cucumbers, flour,
butter, rather more than ½ pint of good
brown gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the cucumbers
lengthwise the size of the dish they
are intended to be served in; empty
them of the seeds, and put them into
boiling water with a little salt, and let
them simmer for 5 minutes; then take
them out, place them in another stewpan,
with the gravy, and let them boil
over a brisk fire until the cucumbers are
tender. Should these be bitter, add a
lump of sugar; carefully dish them,
skim the sauce, pour over the cucumbers,
and serve. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 20
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, when cheapest,
1<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in June, July, and August;
but may be had, forced, from the beginning
of March.</p>


<h3>CUCUMBERS, Stewed with Onions.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 cucumbers, 3 moderate-sized
onions, not quite 1 pint of white
stock, cayenne and salt to taste, the
yolks of 2 eggs, a very little grated nutmeg.
<i>Mode.</i>—Pare and slice the cucumbers,
take out the seeds, and cut the
onions into thin slices; put these both
into a stewpan, with the stock, and let
them boil for ¼ hour or longer, should
the cucumbers be very large. Beat up
the yolks of 2 eggs; stir these into the
sauce; add the cayenne, salt, and grated
nutmeg; bring it to the point of boiling,
and serve. Do not allow the sauce to
boil, or it will curdle. This is a favourite
dish with lamb or mutton chops, rump-steaks,
&amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 20 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, when cheapest, 1<i>d.</i>
each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
in July, August, and September;
but may be had, forced, from the beginning
of March.</p>


<h3>CURRANT DUMPLINGS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of
suet, ½ lb. of currants, rather more than
½ pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Chop the suet
finely, mix it with the flour, and add the
currants, which should be nicely washed,
picked, and dried; mix the whole to a
limp paste with the water (if wanted
very nice, use milk); divide it into 7 or
8 dumplings; tie them in cloths, and
boil for 1¼ hour. They may be boiled
without a cloth: they should then be
made into round balls, and dropped into
boiling water, and should be moved about
at first, to prevent them from sticking
to the bottom of the saucepan. Serve
with a cut lemon, cold butter, and sifted
sugar. <i>Time.</i>—In a cloth, 1¼ hour; without,
¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>CURRANT FRITTERS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls
of flour, 4 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls
of boiled rice, 3 tablespoonfuls of
currants, sugar to taste, a very little
grated nutmeg, hot lard or clarified
dripping. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk into a
basin with the flour, which should previously
be rubbed to a smooth batter
with a little cold milk; stir these ingredients
together; add the well-whisked
eggs, the rice, currants, sugar, and nutmeg.
Beat the mixture for a few minutes,
and, if not sufficiently thick, add a
little more boiled rice; drop it, in small
quantities, into a pan of boiling lard or
clarified dripping; fry the fritters a nice
brown, and, when done, drain them on a
piece of blotting-paper, before the fire.
Pile them on a white d’oyley, strew over
sifted sugar, and serve them very hot.
Send a cut lemon to table with them.
<i>Time.</i>—From 8 to 10 minutes to fry the
fritters. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
3 or 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CURRANT JAM, Black.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit,
weighed before being stripped from the
stalks, allow; ¾ lb. of loaf sugar, 1 gill of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the fruit be very
ripe, and gathered on a dry day. Strip
it from the stalks, and put it into a preserving-pan,
with a gill of water to each
lb. of fruit; boil these together for 10
minutes; then add the sugar, and boil
the jam again for 30 minutes, reckoning
from the time when the jam simmers
equally all over, or longer, should it not
appear to set nicely when a little is
poured on to a plate. Keep stirring it
to prevent it from burning, carefully
remove all the scum, and when done,
pour it into pots. Let it cool, cover the
top of the jam with oiled paper, and the
top of the jars with a piece of tissue-paper
brushed over on both sides with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the white of an egg: this, when cold,
forms a hard stiff cover, and perfectly
excludes the air. Great attention must
be paid to the stirring of this jam, as it
is very liable to burn, on account of the
thickness of the juice. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes
to boil the fruit and water; 30
minutes with the sugar, or longer.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> for a pot
capable of holding 1 lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
from 6 to 7 quarts of currants to
make 1 dozen pots of jam, each pot to
hold 1 lb. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in
July.</p>


<h3>CURRANT JAM, Red.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit allow
¾ lb. of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the
fruit be gathered on a fine day; weigh
it, and then strip the currants from the
stalks; put them into a preserving-pan
with sugar in the above proportion; stir
them, and boil them
for about ¾ hour.
Carefully remove
the scum as it rises.
Put the jam into
pots, and, when
cold, cover with
oiled papers; over
these put a piece
of tissue-paper
brushed over on
both sides with the white of an egg;
press the paper round the top of the pot,
and, when dry, the covering will be quite
hard and air-tight. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour,
reckoning from the time the jam boils all
over. <i>Average cost</i>, for a lb. pot, from
6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow from 6 to 7
quarts of currants to make 12 1-lb. pots
of jam. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in July.</p>

<h3>CURRANT JELLY, Black.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Black currants; to every
pint of juice allow ¼ pint of water, 1 lb
of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Strip the currants
from the stalks, which may be done in
an expeditious manner, by holding the
bunch in one hand, and passing a small
silver fork down the currants: they will
then readily fall from the stalks. Put
them into a jar, place this jar in a saucepan
of boiling water, and simmer them
until their juice is extracted; then strain
them, and to every pint of juice allow
the above proportion of sugar and water;
stir these ingredients together cold until
the sugar is dissolved; place the preserving-pan
on the fire, and boil the jelly
for about ½ hour, reckoning from the
time it commences to boil all over, and
carefully remove the scum as it rises. If
the jelly becomes firm when a little is
put on a plate, it is done; it should then
be put into <i>small</i> pots, and covered the
same as the jam in the preceding recipe.
If the jelly is wanted very clear, the
fruit should not be squeezed dry; but,
of course, so much juice will not be obtained.
If the fruit is not much squeezed,
it may be converted into a jam for immediate
eating, by boiling it with a little
common sugar: this answers very well
for a nursery preserve. <i>Time.</i>—About
¾ hour to extract the juice; ½ hour to
boil the jelly. <i>Average cost</i>, from 8<i>d.</i>
to 10<i>d.</i> per ½-lb. pot. <i>Sufficient.</i>—From
3 pints to 2 quarts of fruit should yield
a pint of juice. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this
in July.</p>


<h3>CURRANT JELLY, Red.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Red currants; to every
pint of juice allow ¾ lb. of loaf sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Have the fruit gathered in fine
weather; pick it from the stalks, put it
into a jar, and place this jar in a saucepan
of boiling water over the fire, and let it simmer
gently until the juice is well drawn
from the currants; then strain them
through a jelly-bag or fine cloth, and if the
jelly is wished very clear, do not squeeze
them <i>too much</i>, as the skin and pulp from
the fruit will be pressed through with the
juice, and so make the jelly muddy.
Measure the juice, and to each pint
allow ¾ lb of loaf sugar; put these into
a preserving-pan, set it over the fire, and
keep stirring the jelly until it is done,
carefully removing every particle of scum
as it rises, using a wooden or silver spoon
for the purpose, as metal or iron ones
would spoil the colour of the jelly.
When it has boiled from 20 minutes to
½ hour, put a little of the jelly on a
plate, and if firm when cool, it is done.
Take it off the fire, pour it into small
gallipots, cover each of the pots with an
oiled paper, and then with a piece of
tissue-paper brushed over on both sides
with the white of an egg. Label the
pots, adding the year when the jelly was
made, and store it away in a dry place.
A jam may be made with the currants,
if they are not squeezed too dry, by
adding a few fresh raspberries, and
boiling all together, with sufficient sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to sweeten it nicely. As this jam is
not worth storing away, but is only for
immediate eating, a smaller proportion
of sugar than usual will be found
enough: it answers very well for children’s
puddings, or for a nursery preserve.
<i>Time.</i>—From ¾ to 1 hour to
extract the juice; 20 minutes to ½ hour
to boil the jelly. <i>Average cost</i>, from
8<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i> per ½-lb. pot. <i>Sufficient.</i>—8
quarts of currants will make from 10
to 12 pots of jelly. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in July.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Should the above proportion of
sugar not be found sufficient for some
tastes, add an extra ¼ lb. to every pint of
juice, making altogether 1 lb.</p>


<h3>CURRANT JELLY, White.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—White currants; to every
pint of juice allow ¾ lb. of good loaf
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick the currants from
the stalks, and put them into a jar;
place this jar in a saucepan of boiling
water, and simmer until the juice is
well drawn from the fruit, which will be
in from ¾ to 1 hour. Then strain the
currants through a fine cloth or jelly-bag;
do not squeeze them too much, or
the jelly will not be clear, and put the
juice into a very clean preserving-pan,
with the sugar. Let this simmer gently
over a clear fire until it is firm, and keep
stirring and skimming until it is done;
then pour it into small pots, cover them,
and store away in a dry place. <i>Time.</i>—¾
hour to draw the juice; ½ hour to boil
the jelly. <i>Average cost</i>, from 8<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i>
per ½-lb. pot. <i>Sufficient.</i>—From 3 pints
to 2 quarts of fruit should yield 1 pint
of juice. <i>Seasonable</i> in July and August.</p>


<h3>CURRANT PUDDING, Boiled
(Plain and Economical).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ½ lb. of
suet, ½ lb. of currants, milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
the currants, dry them thoroughly,
and pick away any stalks or grit; chop
the suet finely; mix all the ingredients
together, and moisten with sufficient
milk to make the pudding into a stiff
batter; tie it up in a floured cloth, put
it into boiling water, and boil for 3½
hours; serve with a cut lemon, cold
butter, and sifted sugar. <i>Time.</i>—3½
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CURRANT PUDDING, Black or
Red.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 quart of red or black
currants, measured with the stalks, ¼ lb.
of moist sugar, suet crust or butter crust
(<i>see</i> recipes for <span class="smcap"><a href="#CRUST_Very_good_Short_for_Fruit_Tarts">Crusts</a></span>). <i>Mode.</i>—Make,
with ¾ lb. of flour, either a suet crust or
butter crust (the former is usually made);
butter a basin, and line it with part
of the crust; add the currants, which
should be stripped from the stalks, and
sprinkle the sugar over them; put the
cover of the pudding on; make the
edges very secure, that the juice does
not escape; tie it down with a floured
cloth, put it into boiling water, and boil
from 2½ to 3 hours. Boiled without a
basin, allow ½ hour less. We have
given rather a large proportion of sugar;
but we find fruit puddings are so
much more juicy and palatable when
<i>well sweetened</i> before they are boiled,
besides being more economical. A few
raspberries added to red-currant pudding
are a very nice addition; about ½
pint would be sufficient for the above
quantity of fruit. Fruit puddings are
very delicious if, when they are turned
out of the basin, the crust is browned
with a salamander, or put into a very
hot oven for a few minutes to colour it:
this makes it crisp on the surface.
<i>Time.</i>—2½ to 3 hours; without a basin,
2 to 2½ hours. <i>Average cost</i>, in full
season, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in June, July, and August.</p>


<h3>CURRANT AND RASPBERRY
TART, Red.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of picked currants,
½ pint of raspberries, 3 heaped
tablespoonfuls of moist sugar, ½ lb of
short crust. <i>Mode.</i>—Strip the currants
from the stalks, and put them into a
deep pie-dish, with a small cup placed
in the midst, bottom upwards; add the
raspberries and sugar; place a border of
paste round the edge of the dish, cover
with crust, ornament the edges, and
bake from ½ to ¾ hour; strew some
sifted sugar over before being sent to
table. This tart is more generally served
cold than hot. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour,
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in June, July, and
August.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—In tarts of this description carefully

<h3>CURRANTS, Iced, for Dessert.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ pint of water, the
whites of 2 eggs, currants, pounded
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Select very fine bunches
of red or white currants, and well beat
the whites of the eggs. Mix these with
the water; then take the currants, a
bunch at a time, and dip them in; let
them drain for a minute or two, and roll
them in very fine-pounded sugar. Lay
them to dry on paper, when the sugar
will crystallize round each currant, and
have a very pretty effect. All fresh
fruit may be prepared in the same manner;
and a mixture of various fruits iced
in this manner, and arranged on one
dish, looks very well for a summer
dessert. <i>Time.</i>—¼ day to dry the fruit.
<i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> for a pint of iced currants.
<i>Seasonable</i> in summer.</p>


<h3>CURRY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Veal, mutton, fowl, or
rabbit; a large onion, butter, brown
gravy or stock, a tablespoonful of curry-powder.

is for a dry curry; more gravy and curry-powder
can be used if preferred. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CURRY ST. LEONARDS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Chicken, or any meat;
2 tablespoonfuls of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls
of curry-powder, 4 or 5 leaves of
mint, a teacup of good gravy, salt, a
dessertspoonful of vinegar, 3 tablespoonfuls

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/illus-094.jpg" width="351" height="87" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">CUSTARDS IN GLASSES.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of milk, 5 eggs,
3 oz. of loaf sugar, 3 laurel-leaves, or
the rind of ½ lemon, or a few drops of
essence of vanilla, 1 tablespoonful of
brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk into a <i>lined</i>
saucepan, with the sugar and whichever
of the above flavourings may be preferred
(the lemon-rind flavours custards
most deliciously), and let the milk steep
by the side of the fire until it is well
flavoured. Bring it to the point of
boiling, then strain it into a basin;
whisk the eggs well, and, when the milk
has cooled a little, stir in the eggs, and
<i>strain</i> this mixture into a jug. Place
this jug in a saucepan of boiling water
over the fire; keep stirring the custard
<i>one way</i> until it thickens; but on no
account allow it to reach the boiling
point, as it will instantly curdle and be
full of lumps. Take it off the fire, stir
in the brandy, and when this is well
mixed with the custard, pour it into
glasses, which should be rather more
than three-parts full; grate a little
nutmeg over the top, and the dish is
ready for table. To make custards look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and eat better, ducks’ eggs should be
used, when obtainable; they add very
much to the flavour and richness, and
so many are not required as of the
ordinary eggs, 4 ducks’ eggs to the pint of
milk making a delicious custard. When
desired extremely rich and good, cream
should be substituted for the milk, and
double the quantity of eggs used to
those mentioned, omitting the whites.
<i>Time.</i>—½ hour to infuse the lemon-rind,
about 10 minutes to stir the custard.
<i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill 8
custard-glasses. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CUSTARD PUDDING, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of milk, the rind
of ¼ lemon, ¼ lb. of moist sugar, 4 eggs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk into a saucepan
with the sugar and lemon-rind, and let
this infuse for about ½ hour, or until the
milk is well flavoured; whisk the eggs,
yolks and whites; pour the milk to
them, stirring all the while; then have
ready a pie-dish, lined at the edge with
paste ready baked; strain the custard
into the dish, grate a little nutmeg over
the top, and bake in a <i>very slow</i> oven for
about ½ hour, or rather longer. The
flavour of this pudding may be varied
by substituting bitter almonds for the
lemon-rind; and it may be very much
enriched by using half cream and half
milk, and doubling the quantity of eggs.
<i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This pudding is usually served
cold with fruit tarts.</p>


<h3>CUSTARD PUDDING, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of milk, 1 tablespoonful
of flour, 4 eggs, flavouring to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Flavour the milk by
infusing in it a little lemon-rind or cinnamon;
whisk the eggs, stir the flour
gradually to these, and pour over them
the milk, and stir the mixture well.
Butter a basin that will exactly hold it;
put in the custard, and tie a floured
cloth over; plunge it into boiling water,
and turn it about for a few minutes, to
prevent the flour from settling in one
part. Boil it slowly for ½ hour; turn
it out of the basin, and serve. The
pudding may be garnished with red-currant
jelly, and sweet sauce may be
sent to table with it. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>CUSTARD SAUCE, for Sweet Puddings
or Tarts.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of milk, 2 eggs,
3 oz. of pounded sugar, 1 tablespoonful
of brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk in a
very clean saucepan, and let it boil.
Beat the eggs, stir to them the milk
and pounded sugar, and put the mixture
into a jug. Place the jug in a saucepan
of boiling water; keep stirring well
until it thickens, but do not allow it to
boil, or it will curdle. Serve the sauce
in a tureen, stir in the brandy, and
grate a little nutmeg over the top.
This sauce may be made very much
nicer by using cream instead of milk;
but the above recipe will be found quite
good enough for ordinary purposes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per pint. <i>Sufficient</i>,
this quantity, for 2 fruit tarts, or 1
pudding.</p>


<h3>CUSTARD TARTLETS, or Fanchonnettes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—For the custard, 4 eggs,
¾ pint of milk, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of
pounded sugar, 3 dessertspoonfuls of
flour, flavouring to taste; the whites of
2 eggs, 2 oz. of pounded sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Well
beat the eggs; stir to them the
milk, the butter, which should be beaten
to a cream, the sugar, and flour; mix
these ingredients well together, put them
into a very clean saucepan, and bring
them to the simmering point, but do not
allow them to boil. Flavour with essence
of vanilla, bitter almonds, lemon, grated
chocolate, or any flavouring ingredient
that may be preferred. Line some
round tartlet-pans with good puff-paste;
fill them with the custard, and bake in a
moderate oven for about 20 minutes;
then take them out of the pans; let
them cool, and in the meantime whisk
the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth;
stir into this the pounded sugar, and
spread smoothly over the tartlets a little
of this mixture. Put them in the oven
again to set the icing, but be particular
that they do not scorch; when the
icing looks crisp, they are done. Arrange
them, piled high in the centre, on a white
napkin, and garnish the dish, and in
between the tartlets, with strips of
bright jelly, or very firmly-made preserve.
<i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to bake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
tartlets; 5 minutes after being iced.
<i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the paste, 1<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> to fill 10 or 12 tartlets, <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The icing may be omitted on
the top of the tartlets, and a spoonful
of any kind of preserve put at the bottom
of the custard instead: this varies
both the flavour and appearance of this
dish.</p>


<h3>CUTLET, the Invalid’s.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 nice cutlet from a loin
or neck of mutton, 2 teacupfuls of water,
1 very small stick of celery, pepper and
salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Have the cutlet
cut from a very nice loin or neck of
mutton; take off all the fat; put it into
a stewpan, with the other ingredients;
stew <i>very gently</i> indeed for nearly 2 hours,
and skim off every particle of fat that
may rise to the surface from time to
time. The celery should be cut into thin
slices before it is added to the meat, and
care must be taken not to put in too
much of this ingredient, or the dish will
not be good. If the water is allowed to
boil fast, the cutlet will be hard. <i>Time.</i>—2
hours’ very gentle stewing. <i>Average
cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 person. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>CUTLETS, Mutton, Italian.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—About 3 lbs. of the neck
of mutton, clarified butter, the yolk of
1 egg, 4 tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs,
1 tablespoonful of minced savoury herbs,
1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful
of minced shalot, 1 saltspoonful
of finely-chopped lemon-peel; pepper,
salt, and pounded mace to taste; flour,
½ pint of hot broth or water, 2 teaspoonfuls
of Harvey’s sauce, 1 teaspoonful of
soy, 2 teaspoonfuls of tarragon vinegar,
1 tablespoonful of port wine. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the mutton into nicely-shaped cutlets,
flatten them, and trim off some of
the fat, dip them in clarified butter, and
then into the beaten yolk of an egg.
Mix well together bread-crumbs, herbs,
parsley, shalot, lemon-peel, and seasoning
in the above proportion, and cover
the cutlets with these ingredients. Melt
some butter in a frying-pan, lay in the
cutlets, and fry them a nice brown; take
them out, and keep them hot before the
fire. Dredge some flour into the pan,
and, if there is not sufficient butter, add
a little more; stir till it looks brown,
then put in the hot broth or water, and
the remaining ingredients; give one boil,
and pour round the cutlets. If the gravy
should not be thick enough, add a little
more flour. Mushrooms, when obtainable,
are a great improvement to this
dish, and when not in season, mushroom-powder
may be substituted for them.
<i>Time.</i>—10 minutes; rather longer, should
the cutlets be very thick. <i>Average cost</i>,
2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

mutton, 1 egg, bread-crumbs, brown
gravy or tomato sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the
remains of cold loin or neck of mutton
into cutlets, trim them, and take away a
portion of the fat, should there be too
much; dip them in beaten egg, and
sprinkle with bread-crumbs, and fry them
a nice brown in hot dripping. Arrange,

<h3>DAMPFNUDELN, or German
Puddings.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ¼ lb. of
butter, 5 eggs, 2 small tablespoonfuls of
yeast, 2 tablespoonfuls of finely-pounded
sugar, milk, a very little salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the flour into a basin, make a hole
in the centre, into which put the yeast,
and rather more than ¼ pint of warm
milk; make this into a batter with the
middle of the flour, and let the sponge
rise in a warm temperature. When sufficiently
risen, mix the eggs, butter,
sugar, and salt, with a little more warm
milk, and knead the whole well together
with the hands, beating the dough until
it is perfectly smooth, and it drops from
the fingers. Then cover the basin with
a cloth, put it in a warm place, and when
the dough has nicely risen, knead it into
small balls; butter the bottom of a deep
sauté-pan, strew over some pounded
sugar, and let the dampfnudeln be laid
in, but do not let them touch one another;
then pour over sufficient milk to
cover them, put on the lid, and let them
rise to twice their original size by the
side of the fire. Now place them in the
oven for a few minutes to acquire a nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
brown colour, and serve them on a napkin,
with custard sauce flavoured with
vanilla, or a compôte of any fruit that
may be preferred. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour
for the sponge to rise; 10 to 15 minutes
for the puddings to rise; 10 minutes to
bake them in a brisk oven. <i>Sufficient</i> for
10 or 12 dampfnudeln. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>DAMSON CHEESE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Damsons; to every lb. of
fruit pulp allow ½ lb. of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick
the stalks from the damsons, and
put them into a preserving-pan; simmer
them over the fire until they are soft, occasionally
stirring them, then beat them
through a coarse sieve, and put the pulp
and juice into the preserving-pan, with
sugar in the above proportion, having
previously carefully weighed them. Stir
the sugar well in, and simmer the damsons
slowly for 2 hours. Skim well, then
boil the preserve quickly for ½ hour, or
until it looks firm and hard in the spoon;
put it quickly into shallow pots, or very
tiny earthenware moulds, and, when
cold, cover it with oiled papers, and the
jars with tissue-paper brushed over on
both sides with the white of an egg. A
few of the stones may be cracked, and
the kernels boiled with the damsons,
which very much improves the flavour of
the cheese. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour to boil the
damsons without the sugar; 2 hours to
simmer them slowly, ½ hour quickly.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 8<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i> per ¼-lb.
pot. <i>Sufficient.</i>—1 pint of damsons to
make a <i>very small</i> pot of cheese. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in September or
October.</p>


<h3>DAMSON JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Damsons; to every lb. of
fruit allow ¾ lb. of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Have
the fruit gathered in dry weather,
pick it over, and reject any that is at all
blemished. Stone the damsons, weigh
them, and to every lb. allow ¾ lb. of loaf
sugar. Put the fruit and sugar into a preserving-pan;
keep stirring them gently
until the sugar is dissolved, and carefully
remove the scum as it rises. Boil the
jam for about an hour, reckoning from
the time it commences to simmer all over
alike: it must be well stirred all the
time, or it will be liable to burn and stick
to the pan, which will cause the jam to
have a very disagreeable flavour. When
the jam looks firm, and the juice appears
to set, it is done; then take it off the
fire, put it into pots, cover it down, when
quite cold, with oiled and egged papers,
and store it away in a dry place. <i>Time.</i>—1
hour after the jam simmers all over.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per lb. pot.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—1½ pint of damsons for a lb.
pot. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in September
or October.</p>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of damsons, ¼ lb.
of moist sugar, ¾ lb. of suet or butter
crust. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a suet crust with
¾ lb. of flour by recipe; line a buttered
pudding-basin with a portion of it; fill
the basin with the damsons, sweeten
them, and put on the lid; pinch the
edges of the crust together, that the
juice does not escape; tie over a floured
cloth, put the pudding into boiling water,
and boil from 2½ to 3 hours. <i>Time.</i>—2½
to 3 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in
September and October.</p>


<h3>DAMSON TART.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of damsons, ¼ lb.
of moist sugar, ½ lb. of short or puff crust.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the damsons, with the sugar
between them, into a deep pie-dish, in
the midst of which place a small cup or
jar turned upside down; pile the fruit
high in the middle, line the edges of the
dish with short or puff crust, whichever
may be preferred; put on the cover, ornament
the edges, and bake from ½ to ¾
hour in a good oven. If puff-crust is
used, about 10 minutes before the pie is
done, take it out of the oven, brush it
over with the white of an egg beaten to
a froth with the blade of a knife; strew
some sifted sugar over, and a few drops
of water, and put the tart back to finish
baking: with short crust, a little plain
sifted sugar, sprinkled over, is all that
will be required. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in September and
October.</p>

the damsons (which should be picked
from the stalks and quite free from
blemishes) into a jar, with pounded sugar
sprinkled amongst them in the above
proportion; tie the jar closely down, set
it in a saucepan of cold water; bring it
gradually to boil, and simmer gently
until the damsons are soft, without being
broken. Let them stand till cold; then
strain the juice from them, boil it up
well, strain it through a jelly-bag, and
pour it over the fruit. Let it cool, cover
with oiled papers, and the jars with tissue-paper
brushed over on both sides with
the white of an egg, and store away in a
dry place. <i>Time.</i>—About ¾ hour to
simmer the fruit after the water boils;

<h3>DESSERT.</h3>

<p>With moderns the dessert is not so
profuse, nor does it hold the same relationship
to the dinner that it held with
the ancients,—the Romans more especially.
On ivory tables they would spread
hundreds of different kinds of raw, cooked,
and preserved fruits, tarts, and cakes,
as substitutes for the more substantial
comestibles with which the guests were
satiated. However, as late as the reigns
of our two last Georges, fabulous sums
were often expended upon fanciful desserts.
The dessert certainly repays, in
its general effect, the expenditure upon
it of much pains; and it may be said,
that if there be any poetry at all in meals,
or the process of feeding, there is poetry
in the dessert, the materials for which
should be selected with taste, and, of
course, must depend, in a great measure,
upon the season. Pines, melons, grapes,
peaches, nectarines, plums, strawberries,
apples, pears, oranges, almonds, raisins,
figs, walnuts, filberts, medlars, cherries,
&amp;c. &amp;c., all kinds of dried fruits, and
choice and delicately-flavoured cakes and
biscuits, make up the dessert, together
with the most costly and <i>recherché</i> wines.
The shape of the dishes varies at different
periods, the prevailing fashion at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
being oval and circular dishes on stems.
The patterns and colours are also subject
to changes of fashion; some persons
selecting china, chaste in pattern and
colour; others, elegantly-shaped glass
dishes on stems, with gilt edges. The
beauty of the dessert services at the
tables of the wealthy tends to enhance
the splendour of the plate. The general
mode of putting a dessert on table, now
the elegant tazzas are fashionable, is, to
place them down the middle of the table,
a tall and short dish alternately; the
fresh fruits being arranged on the tall
dishes, and dried fruits, bon-bons, &amp;c.,
on small round or oval glass plates. The
garnishing needs especial attention, as the
contrast of the brilliant-coloured fruits
with nicely-arranged foliage is very
charming. The garnish <i>par excellence</i> for
dessert is the ice-plant; its crystallized
dewdrops producing a marvellous effect
in the height of summer, giving a most
inviting sense of coolness to the fruit it
encircles. The double-edged mallow,
strawberry, and vine leaves have a pleasing
effect; and for winter desserts, the bay,
cuba, and laurel are sometimes used. In
town, the expense and difficulty of obtaining
natural foliage is great, but paper
and composite leaves are to be purchased
at an almost nominal price. Mixed fruits
of the larger sort are now frequently
served on one dish. This mode admits
of the display of much taste in the arrangement
of the fruit: for instance, a
pine in the centre of the dish, surrounded
with large plums of various sorts and
colours, mixed with pears, rosy-cheeked
apples, all arranged with a due regard to
colour, have a very good effect. Again,
apples and pears look well mingled with
plums and grapes, hanging from the
border of the dish in a négligé sort of
manner, with a large bunch of the same
fruit lying on the top of the apples. A
dessert would not now be considered
complete without candied and preserved
fruits and confections. The candied
fruits may be purchased at a less cost
than they can be manufactured at home.
They are preserved abroad in most ornamental
and elegant forms. And since,
from the facilities of travel, we have become
so familiar with the tables of the
French, chocolate in different forms is
indispensable to our desserts. Olives,
too, should not be omitted; these should
be served in a small, deep glass dish, with
a little of the liquor, or brine, poured over.</p>


<h3>DESSERT DISHES.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 212px;">
<img src="images/illus-103a.jpg" width="212" height="237" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">DISH OF NUTS.</div>
</div>

<p>The tazza, or dish with stem, the same
as that shown in our illustrations, is now
the favourite shape for dessert-dishes.
The fruit can be arranged and shown to
better advantage on these tall high
dishes than on the short flat ones. All
the dishes are now usually placed down
the centre of the table, dried and fresh
fruit alternately, the former being arranged
on small round or oval glass
plates, and the latter on the dishes with
stems. The fruit should always be gathered
on the same day that it is required
for table, and should be tastefully arranged
on the dishes, with leaves between
and round it. By purchasing fruits that
<i>are in season</i>, a dessert can be supplied
at a very moderate cost. These, with a
few fancy biscuits, crystallized fruit,
bon-bons, &amp;c., are sufficient for an ordinary
dessert. When fresh fruit cannot
be obtained, dried and foreign fruits,
compôtes, baked pears, stewed Normandy
pippins, &amp;c. &amp;c., must supply its place,
with the addition of preserves, bon-bons,
cakes, biscuits, &amp;c. At fashionable tables,
forced fruit is served growing in
pots, these pots being hidden in more
ornamental ones, and arranged with the
other dishes. A few vases of fresh
flowers, tastefully arranged, add very
much to the appearance of the dessert;
and, when these are not obtainable, a
few paper ones, mixed with green leaves,
answer very well as a substitute. In
decorating a table, whether for luncheon,
dessert, or supper, a vase or two of
flowers should never be forgotten, as
they add so much to the elegance of the
<i>tout ensemble</i>. In summer and autumn,
ladies residing in the country can always
manage to have a few freshly-gathered
flowers on their tables, and should never
be without this inexpensive luxury. On
the Continent, vases or epergnes filled
with flowers are invariably placed down
the centre of the dinner-table at regular
distances. Ices for dessert are usually
moulded; when this is not the case, they
are handed round in glasses, with wafers
to accompany them. Preserved ginger
is frequently handed round after ices, to
prepare the palate for the delicious dessert
wines. A basin or glass of finely-pounded
lump sugar must never be omitted
at a dessert, as also a glass jug of
fresh cold water (iced, if possible), and
two goblets by its side. Grape scissors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a melon-knife and fork, and nutcrackers,
should always be put on table, if there
are dishes of fruit requiring them. Zests
are sometimes served at the close of the
dessert; such as anchovy toasts or biscuits.
The French often serve plain or
grated cheese with a dessert of fresh or
dried fruits. At some tables, finger-glasses
are placed at the right of each
person, nearly half filled with cold spring
water, and in winter with tepid water.
These precede the dessert. At other
tables, a glass or vase is simply handed
round, filled with perfumed water, into
which each guest dips the corner of his
napkin, and, when needful, refreshes his
lips and the tips of his fingers. After
the dishes are placed, and every one is
provided with plates, glasses, spoons,
&amp;c., the wine should be put at each end
of the table, cooled or otherwise, according
to the season. If the party be small,
the wine may be placed only at the top
of the table, near the host. The following
dishes may be introduced at dessert,
according to season:—</p>

<p><b>Dish of Nuts.</b>—These are merely
arranged piled high in the centre of
the dish, as shown in the engraving,
with or without
leaves round
the edge. Filberts
should
always be
served with
the outer skin
or husk on
them; and
walnuts should
be well wiped
with a damp
cloth, and then
with a dry one,
to remove the unpleasant sticky feeling
the shells frequently have. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Filberts
from September to March;
walnuts from September to January.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Box of French Plums.</b>—If the
box which contains them is exceedingly
ornamental, it
may be placed
on the table;
if small, on a
glass dish; if
large, without
one. French
plums may also be arranged on a glass
plate, and garnished with bright-coloured
sweetmeats, which make a very good
effect. All fancy boxes of preserved
and crystallized fruit may be put on the
table or not, at pleasure. These little
matters of detail must, of course, be left
to individual taste. <i>Seasonable.</i>—May be
purchased all the year; but are in greater
perfection in the winter.</p>

<div class="caption">BOX OF FRENCH PLUMS.</div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Dish of Mixed Fruit.</b>—For a
centre dish, a mixture of various fresh
fruits has a remarkably good effect, particularly
if a pine be added to the list.
A high raised appearance should be given
to the fruit, which is done in the following
manner. Place a tumbler in the
centre of the dish, and, in this tumbler,
the pine, crown uppermost; round the
tumbler put a thick layer of moss, and,
over this, apples, pears, plums, peaches,
and such fruit as is simultaneously in
season. By putting a layer of moss
underneath, so much fruit is not required,
besides giving a better shape to the dish.
Grapes should be placed on the top of
the fruit, a portion of some of the bunches
hanging over the sides of the dish in a
négligé kind of manner, which takes off
the formal look of the dish. In arranging
the plums, apples, &amp;c., let the colours
contrast well. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Suitable for
a dessert in September or October.</p>

<p><b>Box of Chocolate.</b>—This is served
in an ornamental
box,
placed on a
glass plate or
dish. <i>Seasonable.</i>—May
be purchased at any time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Dish of Apples.</b>—The apples should
be nicely wiped with a dry cloth, and
arranged on a dish, piled high in the
centre, with evergreen leaves between
each layer.
The inferior
apples should
form the bottom
layer,
with the
bright-coloured
large ones
at the top.
The leaves of
the laurel,
bay, holly, or
any shrub
green in winter,
are suitable for garnishing dessert
dishes. Oranges may be arranged in the
same manner; they should also be wiped
with a dry cloth before being sent to
table.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Dish of Mixed Summer Fruit.</b>—This
dish consists of cherries, raspberries,
currants, and strawberries, piled in different
layers,
with plenty of
leaves between
each layer, so
that each fruit
is well separated.
The fruit
should be arranged
with a
due regard to
colour, so that
they contrast
nicely one with
the other. Our
engraving shows
a layer of white cherries at the bottom,
then one of red raspberries, over that a
layer of white currants, and at the top
some fine scarlet strawberries. <i>Seasonable</i>
in June, July, and August.</p>

<p><b>Almonds and Raisins.</b>—These are
usually served on glass dishes, the fruit
piled high in the centre, and the almonds
blanched and strewn over. To blanch
the almonds, put them into a small mug
or teacup, pour over them boiling water,
let them remain for 2 or 3 minutes, and
the skins may then be easily removed.
Figs, dates, French plums, &amp;c., are all
served on small glass plates or oval dishes,
but without the almonds. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time, but more suitable in winter,
when fresh fruit is not obtainable.</p>

<p><b>Dish of Strawberries.</b>—Fine strawberries,
arranged in the manner shown
in the engraving, look exceedingly well.
The inferior
ones should be
placed at the
bottom of the
dish, and the
others put in
rows pyramidically,
with the
stalks downwards,
so that
when the whole
is completed,
nothing but the
red part of the
fruit is visible. The fruit should be
gathered with rather long stalks, as there
is then something to support it, and it
can be placed more upright in each layer.
A few of the finest should be reserved to
crown the top.</p>

<h3>DINNER,</h3>

<p>Being the grand solid meal of the day,
is a matter of considerable importance;
and a well-served table is a striking index
of human ingenuity and resource.</p>

<p>The elegance with which a dinner is
served depends, of course, partly upon
the means, but still more upon the taste
of the master and mistress of the house.
It may be observed, in general, that there
should always be flowers on the table,
and, as they form no item of expense
where a garden is, there is no reason
why they should not be employed every
day.</p>

<p>The variety of the dishes which furnish
forth a modern dinner-table, does not
necessarily imply anything unwholesome,
or anything capricious. Food that is not
well relished cannot be well digested;
and the appetite of the over-worked man
of business, or statesman, or of any
dweller in towns, whose occupations are
exciting and exhausting, is jaded, and
requires stimulation. Men and women
who are in rude health, and who have
plenty of air and exercise, eat the simplest
food with relish, and commonly
digest it well; but those conditions are
out of the reach of many men. They
must suit their mode of dining to their
mode of living, if they cannot choose the
latter. It is in serving up food that is at
once appetizing and wholesome that the
skill of the modern housewife is severely
tasked; and she has scarcely a more important
duty to fulfil. It is, in fact, her
particular vocation, in virtue of which
she may be said to hold the health of the
family, and of the friends of the family,
in her hands from day to day.</p>

<p>The following aphorisms and short directions
in relation to dinner-parties, are
well deserving of notice:—“Let the
number of your guests never exceed
twelve, so that the conversation may be
general. Let the temperature of the
dining-room be about 68°. Let the
dishes be few in number in the first
course, but proportionally good. The
order of food is from the most substantial
to the lightest. The order of drinking
wine is from the mildest to the most
foamy and most perfumed. To invite a
person to your house is to take charge of
his happiness so long as he is beneath
your roof. The mistress of the house
should always be certain that the coffee
is excellent; whilst the master should be
answerable for the quality of his wines
and liqueurs.”</p>

<p><i>Dinners à la Russe</i> differ from ordinary
dinners in the mode of serving the various
dishes. In a dinner à la Russe, the
dishes are cut up on a sideboard, and
handed round to the guests, and each
dish may be considered a course. The
table for a dinner à la Russe should be laid
with flowers and plants in fancy flower-pots
down the middle, together with
some of the dessert dishes. A <i>menu</i> or
bill of fare should be placed by the side
of each guest.</p>

<p>The following are bills of fare for dinners
à la Russe, and eatable from July to
November: the dishes can easily be
varied to suit other months.</p>

<h3>DORMERS.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—½
lb. of cold mutton, 2 oz. of beef suet,
pepper and salt to taste, 3 oz. of boiled
rice, 1 egg, bread-crumbs, made gravy.
<i>Mode.</i>—Chop the meat, suet, and rice
finely; mix well together, and add a
high seasoning of pepper and salt, and
roll into sausages; cover them with egg
and bread-crumbs, and fry in hot dripping
of a nice brown. Serve in a dish
with made gravy poured round them, and
a little in a tureen. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour to
fry the sausages. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the meat, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>DRAUGHT for Summer.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The juice of 1 lemon, a
tumblerful of cold water, pounded sugar
to taste, ½ small teaspoonful of carbonate
of soda. <i>Mode.</i>—Squeeze the juice
from the lemon; strain, and add it to the
water, with sufficient pounded sugar to
sweeten the whole nicely. When well
mixed, put in the soda, stir well, and
drink while the mixture is in an effervescing
state.</p>


<h3>DRINK, Pleasant, for Warm Weather.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every ½ pint of good
ale allow 1 bottle of ginger beer. <i>Mode.</i>—For
this beverage the ginger beer must
be in an effervescing state, and the beer
not in the least turned or sour. Mix
them together, and drink immediately.
The draught is refreshing and wholesome,
as the ginger corrects the action of the
beer. It does not deteriorate by standing
a little, but, of course, is better
when taken fresh.</p>


<h3>DRIPPING, to Clarify.</h3>

<p>Good and fresh dripping answers very
well for basting everything except game
and poultry, and, when well clarified,
serves for frying nearly as well as lard; it
should be kept in a cool place, and will
remain good some time. To clarify it
put the dripping into a basin, pour over
it boiling water, and keep stirring the
whole to wash away the impurities. Let
it stand to cool, when the water and
dirty sediment will settle at the bottom of
the basin. Remove the dripping, and
put it away in jars or basins for use.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Another Way.</b>—Put the dripping
into a clean saucepan, and let it boil for
a few minutes over a slow fire, and be
careful to skim it well. Let it stand to
cool a little, then strain it through a
piece of muslin into jars for use. Beef
dripping is preferable to any other for
cooking purposes, as, with mutton dripping,
there is liable to be a tallowy taste
and smell.</p>


<h3>DUCK, Hashed.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast duck, rather
more than 1 pint of weak stock or water,
1 onion, 1 oz. of butter, thickening of
butter and flour, salt and cayenne to
taste, ½ teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel,
1 dessertspoonful of lemon-juice,
½ glass of port wine. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the
duck into nice joints, and put the trimmings
into a stewpan; slice and fry the
onion in a little butter; add these to the
trimmings, pour in the above proportion
of weak stock or water, and stew gently
for 1 hour. Strain the liquor, thicken
it with butter and flour, season with salt
and cayenne, and add the remaining ingredients;
boil it up and skim well; lay
in the pieces of duck, and let them get
thoroughly hot through by the side of
the fire, but do not allow them to boil:
they should soak in the gravy for about
½ hour. Garnish with sippets of toasted
bread. The hash may be made richer
by using a stronger and more highly-flavoured
gravy; a little spice or pounded
mace may also be added, when their
flavour is liked. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, exclusive of cold duck, 4<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> from November to February;
ducklings from May to August.</p>

</div>


<h3>DUCKS, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A couple of ducks; sage-and-onion
stuffing; a little flour. <i>Choosing
and Trussing.</i>—Choose ducks with
plump bellies, and with thick and yellowish
feet. They should be trussed
with the feet on, which should be
scalded, and the skin peeled off, and then
turned up close to the legs. Run a
skewer through the middle of each leg,
after having drawn them as close as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
possible to the body, to plump up the
breast, passing the same quite through
the body. Cut off the heads and necks,
and the pinions at the first joint; bring
these close to the sides, twist the feet
round, and truss them at the back of
the bird. After the duck is stuffed,
both ends should be secured with string,
so as to keep in the seasoning. <i>Mode.</i>—To
insure ducks being tender, never
dress them the same day they are killed;
and, if the weather permits, they should
hang a day or two. Make a stuffing of
sage and onion sufficient for one duck,
and leave the other unseasoned, as the
flavour is not liked by everybody. Put
them down to a brisk clear fire, and keep
them well basted the whole of the time
they are cooking. A few minutes before
serving, dredge them lightly with flour,
to make them froth and look plump; and
when the steam draws towards the fire,
send them to table hot and quickly,
with a good brown gravy poured <i>round</i>,
but not <i>over</i> the ducks, and a little of
the same in a tureen. When in season,
green peas should invariably accompany
this dish. <i>Time.</i>—Full-grown ducks
from ¾ to 1 hour; ducklings from 25 to
35 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, from 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient.</i>—A couple of
ducks for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Ducklings
from April to August; ducks
from November to February.</p>



<h3>DUCK, Roast, to carve.</h3>

<div class="caption">LEG, WING,
AND NECKBONE
OF DUCK.</div>
</div>

<p>No dishes require so much knowledge
and skill in their carving as do game and
poultry; for it is necessary to be well
acquainted with the anatomy of the bird
in order to place the knife at exactly the
proper point. A tough fowl and an old
goose are sad triers of a carver’s powers
and temper, and, indeed, sometimes of
the good humour of those in the neighbourhood
of the carver; for a sudden tilt
of the dish may eventuate in the placing
of a quantity of the gravy in the lap of
the right or left-hand supporter of the
host. We will endeavour to assist those
who are unacquainted
with the “gentle art
of carving,” and also
those who are but
slightly acquainted
with it, by simply describing
the rules to
follow, and referring
to the distinctly-marked
illustrations
of each dish, which
will further help to
bring light to the
minds of the uninitiated.
If the bird
be a young duckling,
it may be carved like
a fowl, viz., by first taking off the leg
and the wing on either side; but in
cases where the duckling is very small,
it will be as well not to separate the leg
from the wing, as they will not then form
too large a portion for a single serving.
After the legs and wings are disposed
of, the remainder of the duck will be
also carved in the same manner as a
fowl; and not much difficulty will be experienced,
as ducklings are tender, and the
joints are easily broken by a little gentle
forcing, or penetrated by the knife. In
cases where the duck is a large bird,
the better plan to pursue is then to carve
it like a goose, that is, by cutting pieces
from the breast in the direction indicated
by the lines marked from 1 to 2, commencing
to carve the slices close to the
wing, and then proceeding upwards from
that to the breastbone. If more should
be wanted than can be obtained from
both sides of the breast, then the legs
and wings must be attacked, in the same
way as is described in connection with
carving a fowl. It may be here remarked,
that as the legs of a duck are
placed far more backward than those of
a fowl, their position causing the waddling
motion of the bird, the thigh-bones
will be found considerably nearer towards
the backbone than in a chicken; this is
the only difference worth mentioning.
The carver should ask each guest if a
portion of stuffing would be agreeable;
and in order to get at this, a cut should
be made below the breast, as shown by
the line from 3 to 4, at the part called
the “apron,” and the spoon inserted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
(As described in the recipe, it is an excellent
plan, when a couple of ducks are
served, to have one with, and the other
without, stuffing.) As to the prime parts
of a duck, it has been said that “the
wing of a flier and the leg of a swimmer”
are severally the best portions. Some
persons are fond of the feet of the duck;
and, in trussing, these should never be
taken off. The leg, wing, and neckbone
are here shown; so that it will be easy
to see the shape they should be when
cut off.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Ducklings are trussed and
roasted in the same manner, and served
with the same sauces and accompaniments.
When in season, do not omit
apple sauce.</p>


<h3>DUCK AND PEAS, Stewed.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast duck, 2 oz. of
butter, 3 or 4 slices of lean ham or bacon,
1 tablespoonful of flour, 2 pints of thin
gravy, 1, or a small bunch of green
onions, 3 sprigs of parsley, 3 cloves, 1
pint of young green peas, cayenne and
salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of pounded
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the butter into a
stewpan; cut up the duck into joints, lay
them in with the slices of lean ham or
bacon; make it brown, then dredge in a
tablespoonful of flour, and stir this well
in before adding the gravy. Put in the
onion, parsley, cloves, and gravy, and
when it has simmered for ¼ hour, add a
pint of young green peas, and stew gently
for about ½ hour. Season with cayenne,
salt, and sugar; take out the duck, place
it round the dish, and the peas in the
middle. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
exclusive of the cold duck, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
from June to August.</p>


<h3>DUCK AND PEAS, Stewed.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast duck, ½ pint
of good gravy, cayenne and salt to taste,
½ teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1
teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 oz. of
butter rolled in flour, 1½ pint of green
peas. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the duck into
joints, lay it in the gravy, and add a
seasoning of cayenne, salt, and minced
lemon-peel; let this gradually warm
through, but not boil. Throw the peas
into boiling water slightly salted, and
boil them rapidly until tender. Drain
them, stir in the pounded sugar, and the
butter rolled in flour; shake them over
the fire for two or three minutes, and
serve in the centre of the dish, with the
duck laid round. <i>Time.</i>—15 minutes to
boil the peas, when they are full grown.
<i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the cold duck,
10<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from June to August.</p>


<h3>DUCK, Stewed, in Turnips.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold duck, ½ pint of
good gravy, 4 shalots, a few slices of carrot,
a small bunch of savoury herbs, 1
blade of pounded mace, 1 lb. of turnips
weighed after being peeled, 2 oz. of
butter, pepper and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
up the duck into joints, fry the
shalots, carrots, and herbs, and put them
with the duck into the gravy. Cut about
1 lb. of turnips into ½ inch squares, put
the butter into a stewpan, and stew them
till quite tender, which will be in about
½ hour, or rather more; season with
pepper and salt, and serve on the centre
of the dish, with the duck, &amp;c., laid
round. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more than ½ hour
to stew the turnips. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of cold duck, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from
November to February.</p>


<h3>DUCK, to Ragoût a whole.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 large duck, pepper and
salt to taste, good beef gravy, 2 onions
sliced, 4 sage-leaves, a few leaves of lemon
thyme, thickening of butter and flour.
<i>Mode.</i>—After having emptied and singed
the duck, season it inside with pepper
and salt, and truss it. Roast it before a
clear fire for about 20 minutes, and let it
acquire a nice brown colour. Put it into
a stewpan with sufficient well-seasoned
beef gravy to cover it; slice and fry the
onions, and add these, with the sage-leaves
and lemon thyme, both of which
should be finely minced, to the stock.
Simmer gently until the duck is tender;
strain, skim, and thicken the gravy with
a little butter and flour; boil it up, pour
over the duck, and serve. When in
season, about 1½ pint of young green peas,
boiled separately, and put in the ragoût,
very much improve this dish. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes to roast the duck; 20 minutes
to stew it. <i>Average cost</i>, from 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> to
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from November to February;
ducklings from April to August.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<h3>DUCK, Wild, Hashed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold roast
wild duck, 1 pint of good brown gravy,
2 tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs, 1 glass
of claret, salt, cayenne, and mixed spices
to taste; 1 tablespoonful of lemon or
Seville orange-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the
remains of the duck into neat joints, put
them into a stewpan, with all the above ingredients;
let them get gradually hot by
the side of the fire, and occasionally stir
the contents; when on the point of boiling,
serve, and garnish the dish with sippets
of toasted bread. <i>Time.</i>—About ¼ hour.
<i>Seasonable</i> from November to February.</p>


<h3>DUCK, Wild, Ragoût of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 wild ducks, 4 shalots,
1 pint of stock (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#STOCKS">Stock</a></span>), 1 glass of port
wine, 1 oz. of butter, a little flour, the
juice of ½ lemon, cayenne and salt to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Ducks that have been
dressed and left from the preceding day
will answer for this dish. Cut them into
joints, reserve the legs, wings, and
breasts until wanted; put the trimmings
into a stewpan with the shalots and
stock, and let them simmer for about ½
hour, and strain the gravy. Put the
butter into a stewpan; when melted,
dredge in a little flour, and pour in the
gravy made from the bones; give it one
boil, and strain it again; add the wine,
lemon-juice, and cayenne; lay in the
pieces of duck, and let the whole gradually
warm through, but do not allow
it to boil, or the duck will be hard. The
gravy should not be too thick, and should
be very highly seasoned. The squeeze
of a Seville orange is a great improvement
to this dish. <i>Time.</i>—About ½ hour
to make the gravy; ¼ hour for the duck
gradually to warm through. <i>Seasonable</i>
from November to February.</p>


<h3>DUCK, Wild, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Wild duck, flour, butter.
<i>Mode.</i>—Carefully pluck and draw them;
cut off the heads close to the necks,
leaving sufficient skin to turn over, and
do not cut off the feet; some twist each
leg at the knuckle, and rest the claws on
each side of the breast; others truss
them as shown in our illustration. Roast
the birds before a quick fire, and, when
they are first put down, let them remain
for 5 minutes without basting (this
will keep the gravy in); afterwards baste
plentifully with butter, and a few minutes
before serving dredge them lightly with
flour; baste well, and send them to table
nicely frothed, and full of gravy. If
overdone, the birds will lose their flavour.
Serve with a good gravy in the dish, or
orange gravy, and send to table with
them a cut lemon. To take off the fishy
taste which wild fowl sometimes have,
baste them for a few minutes with hot
water to which have been added an onion
and a little salt; then take away the pan,
and baste with butter. <i>Time.</i>—When
liked under-dressed, 20 to 25 minutes;
well done, 25 to 35 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> the couple.</p>

<h3>DUCK, Wild, to Carve.</h3>

<p>As game is almost universally served
as a dainty, and not as a dish to stand
the assaults of an altogether fresh appetite,
these dishes are not usually cut
up entirely,
but only
those parts
are served
of each
which are
considered
the best flavoured and the primest. Of
wild fowl, the breast alone is considered
by epicures worth eating, and slices are
cut from this, in the direction indicated
by the lines, from 1 to 2; if necessary,
the leg and the wing can be taken off by
passing the knife from 3 to 4, and by
generally following the directions described
for carving boiled fowl.</p>

<h3>DUMPLINGS, Sussex, or Hard.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ½ pint of
water, ½ saltspoonful of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix
the flour and water together to a
smooth paste, previously adding a small
quantity of salt. Form this into small
round dumplings; drop them into boiling
water, and boil from ½ to ¾ hour.
They maybe served with roast or boiled
meat; in the latter case, they may be
cooked with the meat, but should be
dropped into the water when it is quite
boiling. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour. <i>Sufficient</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
for 10 or 12 dumplings. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>DUTCH FLUMMERY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ oz. of isinglass, the
rind and juice of 1 lemon, 1 pint of water,
4 eggs, 1 pint of sherry, Madeira, or
raisin-wine; sifted sugar to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the water, isinglass, and lemon-rind
into a lined saucepan, and simmer
gently until the isinglass is dissolved;
strain this into a basin, stir in the eggs,
which should be well beaten, the lemon-juice,
which should be strained, and the
wine; sweeten to taste with pounded
sugar, mix all well together, pour it into
a jug, set this jug in a saucepan of boiling
water over the fire, and keep stirring
it one way until it thickens; but <i>take
care that it does not boil</i>. Strain it into
a mould that has been oiled or laid in
water for a short time, and put it in a
cool place to set. A tablespoonful of
brandy stirred in just before it is poured
into the mould, improves the flavour of
this dish: it is better if it is made the
day before it is required for table. <i>Time.</i>—¼
hour to simmer the isinglass; about
¼ hour to stir the mixture over the fire.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, if made with sherry;
less with raisin-wine. <i>Sufficient</i> to fill a
quart mould. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>EEL BROTH.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of eel, a small
bunch of sweet herbs, including parsley,
½ onion, 10 peppercorns, 3 pints of water,
2 cloves, salt and pepper to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—After
having cleaned and skinned the
eel, cut it into small pieces, and put it
into a stewpan with the other ingredients;
simmer gently until the liquid is
reduced to nearly half, carefully removing
the scum as it rises. Strain it
through a hair sieve: put it by in a cool
place, and, when wanted, take off all the
fat on the top; warm up as much as is
required, and serve with sippets of toasted
bread. This is a very nutritious broth,
and easy of digestion. <i>Time.</i>—To be
simmered until the liquor is reduced to
half. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to
make 1½ pint of broth. <i>Seasonable</i> from
June to March.</p>


<h3>EEL PIE.</h3>

chopped parsley, 1 shalot, grated nutmeg,
pepper and salt to taste, the juice
of ½ a lemon, small quantity of forcemeat,
¼ pint of Béchamel; puff paste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Skin and wash the eels, cut them
in pieces 2 inches long, and line the
bottom of the pie-dish with forcemeat.
Put in the eels, and sprinkle them with the
parsley, shalots, nutmeg, seasoning, and
lemon-juice, and cover with puff paste.
Bake for 1 hour, or rather more; make
the Béchamel hot, and pour it into the
pie. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more than 1 hour.
<i>Seasonable</i> from August to March.</p>


<h3>EEL SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 lbs. of eels, 1 onion,
2 oz. of butter, 3 blades of mace, 1 bunch
of sweet herbs, ¼ oz. of peppercorns, salt
to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, ¼ pint
of cream, 2 quarts of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
the eels, cut them into thin slices,
and put them into the stewpan with the
butter; let them simmer for a few minutes,
then pour the water to them, and
add the onion, cut in thin slices, the
herbs, mace, and seasoning. Simmer till
the eels are tender, but do not break the
fish. Take them out carefully, mix the
flour smoothly to a batter with the cream,
bring it to a boil, pour over the eels, and
serve. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour or rather more.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
from June to March. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8
persons.</p>

sauce.</p>


<h3>EELS, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 small eels, sufficient
water to cover them; a large bunch of
parsley. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose small eels for
boiling; put them into a stewpan with the
parsley, and just sufficient water to cover
them; simmer till tender. Take them
out, pour a little parsley and butter over
them, and serve some in a tureen. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per lb.

<h3>EEL, Collared.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 large eel; pepper and
salt to taste; 2 blades of mace, 2 cloves,
a little allspice very finely pounded, 6
leaves of sage, and a small bunch of
herbs minced very small. <i>Mode.</i>—Bone
the eel and skin it; split it, and sprinkle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it over with the ingredients, taking care
that the spices are very finely pounded,
and the herbs chopped very small. Roll
it up and bind with a broad piece of tape,
and boil it in water, mixed with a little
salt and vinegar, till tender. It may either
be served whole or cut in slices; and
when cold, the eel should be kept in the

<h3>EGGS.</h3>

<p>There is only one opinion as to the
nutritive properties of eggs, although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
qualities of those belonging to different
birds vary somewhat. Those of the
common hen are most esteemed as delicate
food, particularly when “new-laid.”
The quality of eggs depends
much upon the food given to the hen.
Eggs in general are considered most
easily digestible when little subjected to
the art of cookery. The lightest way
of dressing them is by poaching, which
is effected by putting them for a minute
or two into brisk boiling water: this coagulates
the external white, without doing
the inner part too much. Eggs are much
better when new-laid than a day or two
afterwards. The usual time allotted for
boiling eggs in the shell is 3 to 3¾ minutes:
less time than that in boiling
water will not be sufficient to solidify the
white, and more will make the yolk hard
and less digestible: it is very difficult
to <i>guess</i> accurately as to the time. Great
care should be employed in putting them
into the water, to prevent cracking the
shell, which inevitably causes a portion
of the white to exude, and lets water into
the egg. For the purpose of placing eggs
in water, always choose a <i>large</i> spoon in
preference to a small one. Eggs are often
beaten up raw in nutritive beverages.</p>

<p>The eggs of the <i>turkey</i> are almost as
mild as those of the hen; the egg of the
<i>goose</i> is large, but well-tasted. <i>Ducks’
eggs</i> have a rich flavour; the albumen is
slightly transparent, or bluish, when set
or coagulated by boiling, which requires
less time than hens’ eggs. <i>Guinea-fowl
eggs</i> are smaller and more delicate than
those of the hen. Eggs of <i>wild fowl</i> are
generally coloured, often spotted; and
the taste generally partakes somewhat
of the bird they belong to. Those of
land birds that are eaten, as the <i>plover</i>,
<i>lapwing</i>, <i>ruff</i>, &amp;c., are in general much
esteemed; but those of <i>sea-fowl</i> have,
more or less, a strong fishy taste. The
eggs of the <i>turtle</i> are very numerous:
they consist of yolk only, without shell,
and are delicious.</p>

<p>When fresh eggs are dropped into a
vessel <i>full</i> of boiling water, they crack,
because the eggs being well filled, the
shells give way to the efforts of the interior
fluids, dilated by heat. If the
volume of hot water be small, the shells
do not crack, because its temperature is
reduced by the eggs before the interior
dilation can take place. Stale eggs,
again, do not crack because the air inside
is easily compressed.</p>


<h3>EGG BALLS, for Soups and made
Dishes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 eggs, a little flour;
seasoning to taste of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
6 eggs for 20 minutes, strip off the shells,
take the yolks and pound them in a
mortar. Beat the yolks of the 2 uncooked
eggs; add them, with a little flour and
salt, to those pounded; mix all well together,
and roll into balls. Boil them
before they are put into the soup or other
dish they may be intended for.</p>


<h3>EGG SAUCE, for Salt Fish.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, ½ pint of melted
butter, when liked, a very little lemon-juice.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil the eggs until quite
hard, which will be in about 20 minutes,
and put them into cold water for ½ hour.
Strip off the shells, chop the eggs into
small pieces, not, however, too fine.
Make the melted butter very smooth,
and, when boiling, stir in the eggs, and
serve very hot. Lemon-juice may be
added at pleasure. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes
to boil the eggs. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient.</i>—This quantity for 3 or 4 lbs.
of fish.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When a thicker sauce is required,
use one or two more eggs to the
same quantity of melted butter.</p>


<h3>EGG SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A tablespoonful of flour,
4 eggs, 2 small blades of finely-pounded
mace, 2 quarts of stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat
up the flour smoothly in a teaspoonful of
cold stock, and put in the eggs; throw
them into boiling stock, stirring all the
time. Simmer for ¼ of an hour. Season
and serve with a French roll in the tureen
or fried sippets of bread. <i>Time.</i>—½ an
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 11<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8
persons.</p>


<h3>EGG WINE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 egg, 1 tablespoonful
and ½ glass of cold water, 1 glass of
sherry, sugar and grated nutmeg to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat the egg, mixing
with it a tablespoonful of cold water;
make the wine-and-water hot, but not
boiling; pour it on the egg, stirring all
the time. Add sufficient lump sugar to
sweeten the mixture, and a little grated
nutmeg; put all into a very clean saucepan,
set it on a gentle fire, and stir the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
contents one way until they thicken,
but <i>do not allow them to boil</i>. Serve in a
glass with sippets of toasted bread or
plain crisp biscuits. When the egg is
not warmed, the mixture will be found
easier of digestion, but it is not so pleasant
a drink. <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 person.</p>


<h3>EGGS, to Boil for Breakfast, Salads,
&amp;c.</h3>

<p>Eggs for boiling cannot be too fresh,
or boiled too soon after they are laid;
but rather a longer time should be allowed
for boiling a new-laid egg than for
one that is three or four days old. Have
ready a saucepan of boiling water; put
the eggs into it gently with a spoon,
letting the spoon touch the bottom of the
saucepan before it is withdrawn, that the
egg may not fall, and consequently crack.
For those who like eggs lightly boiled, 3
minutes will be found sufficient; 3¾ to 4
minutes will be ample time to set the
white nicely; and, if liked hard, 6 to 7 minutes
will not be found too long. Should
the eggs be unusually large, as those of
black Spanish fowls sometimes are, allow
an extra ½ minute for them. Eggs for
salads should be boiled from 10 minutes
to ¼ hour, and should be placed in a basin
of cold water for a few minutes; they
should then be rolled on the table with
the hand, and the shell will peel off easily.
<i>Time.</i>—To boil eggs lightly, for invalids
or children, 3 minutes; to boil eggs to
suit the generality of tastes, 3¾ to 4
minutes; to boil eggs hard, 6 to 7 minutes;
for salads, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

<div class="caption">EGG-STAND FOR THE BREAKFAST-TABLE.</div>
</div>


<h3>EGGS, Buttered.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 new-laid eggs, 2 oz. of
butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Procure the eggs new-laid
if possible; break them into a basin,
and beat them well; put the butter into
another basin, which place in boiling
water, and stir till the butter is melted.
Pour that and the eggs into a lined
saucepan; hold it over a gentle fire, and,
as the mixture begins to warm, pour it
two or three times into the basin, and
back again, that the two ingredients may
be well incorporated. Keep stirring the
eggs and butter one way until they are
hot, <i>without boiling</i>, and serve on hot
buttered toast. If the mixture is allowed
to boil, it will curdle, and so be entirely
spoiled. <i>Time.</i>—About 5 minutes to
make the eggs hot. <i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow a slice to each person.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>EGGS, to Choose.</h3>

<p>In choosing eggs, apply the tongue to
the large end of the egg, and, if it feels
warm, it is new, and may be relied on as
a fresh egg. Another mode of ascertaining
their freshness is to hold them
before a lighted candle or to the light,
and, if the egg looks clear, it will be
tolerably good; if thick, it is stale; and
if there is a black spot attached to the
shell, it is worthless. No egg should be
used for culinary purposes with the
slightest taint in it, as it will render
perfectly useless those with which it has
been mixed. Eggs that are purchased,
and that cannot be relied on, should
always be broken in a cup, and then put
into a basin: by this means stale or bad
eggs may be easily rejected, without
wasting the others.</p>


<h3>EGGS, Ducks’.</h3>

<p>Ducks’ eggs are usually so strongly
flavoured that, plainly boiled, they are
not good for eating; they answer, however,
very well for various culinary preparations
where eggs are required; such
as custards, &amp;c. &amp;c. Being so large
and highly-flavoured, 1 duck’s egg will
go as far as 2 small hen’s eggs, besides
making whatever they are mixed with
exceedingly rich. They also are admirable
when used in puddings.</p>


<h3>EGGS, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, ¼ lb. of lard,
butter or clarified dripping. <i>Mode.</i>—Place
a delicately-clean frying-pan over
a gentle fire; put in the fat, and allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
it to come to the boiling-point. Break
the eggs into cups, slip them into the
boiling fat,
and let them
remain until
the whites are
delicately
set; and, whilst they are frying, ladle
a little of the fat over them. Take them
up with a slice, drain them for a minute
from their greasy moisture, trim them
neatly, and serve on slices of fried bacon
or ham; or the eggs may be placed in the
middle of the dish, with the bacon put
round as a garnish. <i>Time.</i>—2 to 3 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> each; 2<i>d.</i> when
scarce. <i>Sufficient</i> for 2 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<h3>EGGS à la Maître d’Hôtel.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of fresh butter, 1
tablespoonful of flour, ½ pint of milk,
pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful
of minced parsley, the juice of ½ lemon,
6 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the flour and half
the butter into a stewpan; stir them
over the fire until the mixture thickens;
pour in the milk, which should be boiling;
add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and
simmer the whole for 5 minutes. Put
the remainder of the butter into the
sauce, and add the minced parsley; then
boil the eggs hard, strip off the shell, cut
the eggs into quarters, and put them on
a dish. Bring the sauce to the boiling-point,
add the lemon-juice, pour over the
eggs and serve. <i>Time.</i>—5 minutes to
boil the sauce; the eggs, 10 to 15 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>EGGS, to Pickle.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—16 eggs, 1 quart of
vinegar, ½ oz. of black pepper, ½ oz. of
Jamaica pepper, ½ oz. of ginger. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the eggs for 12 minutes, then dip
them into cold water, and take off the
shells. Put the vinegar, with the pepper
and ginger, into a stewpan, and let it
simmer for 10 minutes. Now place the
eggs in a jar, pour over them the vinegar,
&amp;c., boiling hot, and, when cold, tie them
down with bladder to exclude the air.
This pickle will be ready for use in a
month. <i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity,
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable.</i>—This should be
made about Easter, as at this time eggs
are plentiful and cheap. A store of
pickled eggs will be found very useful
and ornamental in serving with many
first and second course dishes.</p>


<h3>EGGS AU PLAT, or AU MIROIR,
served on the Dish in which they
are Cooked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, 1 oz. of butter,
pepper and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Butter
a dish rather thickly with good fresh
butter; melt it, break the eggs into it
the same as for poaching, sprinkle them
with white pepper and fine salt, and put
the remainder of the butter, cut into
very small pieces, on the top of them.
Put the dish on a hot plate, or in the
oven, or before the fire, and let it remain
until the whites become set, but not hard,
when serve immediately, placing the dish
they were cooked in on another. To
hasten the cooking of the eggs, a salamander
may be held over them for a
minute; but great care must be taken
that they are not too much done. This
is an exceedingly nice dish, and one very
easily prepared for breakfast. <i>Time.</i>—3
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 2 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>EGGS, Plovers’.</h3>

<p>Plovers’ eggs are usually served boiled
hard, and sent to table in a napkin,
either hot or cold; they may also be
shelled, and served the same as eggs à la
Tripe, with a good Béchamel sauce, or
brown gravy, poured over them. They
are also used for decorating salads, the
beautiful colour of the white being generally
so much admired.</p>


<h3>EGGS, Poached.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Eggs, water. To every
pint of water allow 1 tablespoonful of
vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Eggs for poaching
should be perfectly fresh, but not quite
new-laid; those that are about 36 hours
old are the best for the purpose. If
quite new-laid, the white is so milky it
is almost impossible to set it; and, on
the other hand, if the egg be at all stale,
it is equally difficult to poach it nicely.
Strain some boiling water into a deep
clean frying-pan; break the egg into a
cup without damaging the yolk, and,
when the water boils, remove the pan to
the side of the fire, and gently slip the
egg into it. Place the pan over a gentle
fire, and keep the water simmering until
the white looks nicely set, when the egg
is ready. Take it up gently with a slice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
cut away the ragged edges of the white,
and serve either on toasted bread or on
slices of ham
or bacon, or on
spinach, &amp;c. A
poached egg
should not
be overdone,
as its appearance and taste will be quite
spoiled if the yolk be allowed to harden.
When the egg is slipped into the water,
the white should be gathered together,
to keep it a little in form, or the cup
should be turned over it for ½ minute.
To poach an egg to perfection is rather a
difficult operation; so, for inexperienced
cooks, a tin egg-poacher may be purchased,
which greatly facilitates this
manner of dressing eggs. Our illustration
clearly shows what it is: it consists
of a tin plate with a handle, with a space
for three perforated cups. An egg
should be broken into each cup, and the
machine then placed in a stewpan of
boiling water, which has been previously
strained. When the whites of the eggs
appear set, they are done, and should
then be carefully slipped on to the toast
or spinach, or with whatever they are
served. In poaching eggs in a frying-pan,
never do more than four at a time;
and, when a little vinegar is liked mixed
with the water in which the eggs are
done, use the above proportion. <i>Time.</i>—2½
to 3½ minutes, according to the size of
the egg. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 2 eggs to
each person. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time,
but less plentiful in winter.</p>

<h3>EGGS, Poached, with Cream.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of water, 1 teaspoonful
of salt, 4 teaspoonfuls of vinegar,
4 fresh eggs, ½ gill of cream, salt, pepper,
and pounded sugar to taste, 1 oz. of
butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the water, vinegar,
and salt into a frying-pan, and break
each egg into a separate cup; bring the
water, &amp;c., to boil, and slip the eggs
gently into it without breaking the yolks.
Simmer them from 3 to 4 minutes, but
not longer, and, with a slice, lift them
out on to a hot dish, and trim the edges.
Empty the pan of its contents, put in
the cream, add a seasoning to taste of
pepper, salt, and pounded sugar; bring
the whole to the boiling-point; then add
the butter, broken into small pieces;
toss the pan round and round till the
butter is melted; pour it over the eggs,
and serve. To insure the eggs not being
spoiled whilst the cream, &amp;c. is preparing,
it is a good plan to warm the cream with
the butter, &amp;c. before the eggs are
poached, so that it may be poured over
them immediately after they are dished.
<i>Time.</i>—3 to 4 minutes to poach the
eggs, 5 minutes to warm the cream.
<i>Average cost</i> for the above quantity, 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 2 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>EGGS, Scotch.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls
of forcemeat, hot lard, ½ pint of good
brown gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the eggs for
10 minutes; strip them from the shells,
and cover them with forcemeat, or substitute
pounded anchovies for the ham.
Fry the eggs a nice brown in boiling
lard, drain them before the fire from
their greasy moisture, dish them, and
pour round from ¼ to ½ pint of good
brown gravy. To enhance the appearance
of the eggs, they may be rolled in
beaten egg and sprinkled with bread-crumbs;
but this is scarcely necessary if
they are carefully fried. The flavour of
the ham or the anchovy in the forcemeat
must preponderate, as it should be very
relishing. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes to boil
the eggs, 5 to 7 minutes to fry them.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>EGGS, Snow, or Œufs à la Neige
(a very pretty Supper Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, ¾ pint of milk,
pounded sugar to taste, flavouring of
vanilla, lemon-rind, or orange-flower
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk into a
saucepan with sufficient sugar to sweeten
it nicely, and the rind of ½ lemon. Let
this steep by the side of the fire for
½ hour, when take out the peel; separate
the whites from the yolks of the eggs,
and whisk the former to a perfectly stiff
froth, or until there is no liquid remaining;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
bring the milk to the boiling-point,
drop in the snow a tablespoonful at a
time, and keep turning the eggs until
sufficiently cooked. Then place them
on a glass dish, beat up the yolks of the
eggs, stir to them the milk, add a little
more sugar, and strain this mixture into
a jug; place the jug in a saucepan of
boiling water, and stir it one way until
the mixture thickens, but do not allow
it to boil, or it will curdle. Pour this
custard over the eggs, when they should
rise to the surface. They make an exceedingly
pretty addition to a supper,
and should be put in a cold place after
being made. When they are flavoured
with vanilla or orange-flowered water, it
is not necessary to steep the milk. A
few drops of the essence of either may
be poured into the milk just before the
whites are poached. In making the
custard, a little more flavouring and
sugar should always be added. <i>Time.</i>—About
2 minutes to poach the whites;
8 minutes to stir the custard. <i>Average
cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>EGGS, to keep Fresh for several
Weeks.</h3>

<p>Have ready a large saucepan, capable
of holding 3 or 4 quarts, full of boiling
water. Put the eggs into a cabbage-net,
say 20 at a time, and hold them in the
water (which must be kept boiling) <i>for</i>
20 <i>seconds</i>. Proceed in this manner till
you have done as many eggs as you wish
to preserve; then pack them away in
sawdust. We have tried this method of
preserving eggs, and can vouch for its
excellence. They will be found, at the
end of 2 or 3 months, quite good enough
for culinary purposes; and although the
white may be a little tougher than that
of a new-laid egg, the yolk will be nearly
the same. Many persons keep eggs for
a long time by smearing the shells with
butter or sweet oil: they should then be
packed in plenty of bran or sawdust,
and the eggs not allowed to touch each
other. Eggs for storing should be collected
in fine weather, and should not be
more than 24 hours old when they are
packed away, or their flavour, when
used, cannot be relied on. Another
simple way of preserving eggs is to
immerse them in lime-water soon after
they have been laid, and then to put the
vessel containing the lime-water in a
cellar or cool outhouse. <i>Seasonable.</i>—The
best time for preserving eggs is
from April to September.</p>


<h3>EGGS, à la Tripe.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 eggs, ¾ pint of Béchamel
sauce, dessertspoonful of finely-minced
parsley. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the eggs hard;
put them into cold water, peel them,
take out the yolks whole, and shred the
whites. Make ¾ pint of Béchamel sauce;
add the parsley, and, when the sauce is
quite hot, put the yolks of the eggs into
the middle of the dish, and the shred
whites round them; pour over the sauce,
and garnish with leaves of puff-paste or
fried croûtons. There is no necessity
for putting the eggs into the saucepan
with the Béchamel; the sauce, being
quite hot, will warm the eggs sufficiently.
<i>Time.</i>—10 minutes to boil the eggs.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>ELDER WINE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every 3 gallons of
water allow 1 peck of elderberries; to
every gallon of juice allow 3 lbs. of sugar,
½ oz. of ground ginger, 6 cloves, 1 lb. of
good Turkey raisins; ¼ pint of brandy
to every gallon of wine. To every 9 gallons
of wine, 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of
fresh brewer’s yeast. <i>Mode.</i>—Pour the
water, quite boiling, on the elderberries,
which should be picked from the stalks,
and let these stand covered for 24 hours;
then strain the whole through a sieve or
bag, breaking the fruit to express all the
juice from it. Measure the liquor, and
to every gallon allow the above proportion
of sugar. Boil the juice and sugar with
the ginger, cloves, and raisins for 1 hour,
skimming the liquor the whole time; let
it stand until milk-warm, then put it into
a clean dry cask, with 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls
of good fresh yeast to every 9 gallons
of wine. Let it ferment for about a
fortnight; then add the brandy, bung
up the cask, and let it stand some
months before it is bottled, when it will
be found excellent. A bunch of hops
suspended to a string from the bung,
some persons say, will preserve the wine
good for several years. Elder wine is
usually mulled, and served with sippets
of toasted bread and a little grated nutmeg.
<i>Time.</i>—To stand covered for 24
hours; to be boiled 1 hour. <i>Average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
cost</i>, when made at home, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
gallon. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in September.</p>


<h3>ENDIVE.</h3>

<p>This vegetable, so beautiful in appearance,
makes an excellent addition to
winter salad, when lettuces and other
winter salads are not obtainable. It is
usually placed in the centre of the dish,
and looks remarkably pretty with slices
of beetroot, hard-boiled eggs, and curled
celery placed round it, so that the colours
contrast nicely. In preparing it, carefully
wash and cleanse it free from insects,
which are generally found near the heart;
remove any decayed or dead leaves, and
dry it thoroughly by shaking in a cloth.
This vegetable may also be served hot,
stewed in cream, brown gravy, or butter;
but when dressed thus, the sauce it is
stewed in should not be very highly
seasoned, as that would destroy and
overpower the flavour of the vegetable.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> per head. <i>Sufficient.</i>—1
head for a salad for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from November to March.</p>


<h3>ENDIVE, à la Française.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 heads of endive, 1 pint
of broth, 3 oz. of fresh butter; salt,
pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash and boil the endive as in
the preceding recipe; chop it rather
fine, and put into a stewpan with the
broth; boil over a brisk fire until the
sauce is all reduced; then put in the
butter, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg
(the latter must be very sparingly used);
mix all well together, bring it to the
boiling point, and serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes to boil, 5 minutes to simmer
in the broth. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> per head.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from November to March.</p>


<h3>ENDIVE, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 heads of endive, salt
and water, 1 pint of broth, thickening of
butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice,
a small lump of sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
and free the endive thoroughly
from insects, remove the green part of
the leaves, and put it into boiling water,
slightly salted. Let it remain for 10
minutes; then take it out, drain it till
there is no water remaining, and chop it
very fine. Put it into a stewpan with
the broth; add a little salt and a lump
of sugar, and boil until the endive is
perfectly tender. When done, which
may be ascertained by squeezing a piece
between the thumb and finger, add a
thickening of butter and flour and the
lemon-juice; let the sauce boil up, and
serve. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes to boil, 5
minutes to simmer in the broth. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> per head. <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from November to
March.</p>


<h3>ESPAGNOLE, or Brown Spanish
Sauce.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 slices of lean ham, 1 lb.
of veal, 1½ pint of white stock, 2 or 3
sprigs of parsley, ½ a bay-leaf, 2 or 3
sprigs of savoury herbs, 6 green onions,
3 shalots, 2 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2
glasses of sherry or Madeira, thickening
of butter and flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the
ham and veal into small square pieces,
and put them into a stewpan. Moisten
these with ½ pint of the stock, and
simmer till the bottom of the stewpan is
covered with a nicely-coloured glaze,
when put in a few more spoonfuls to
detach it. Add the remainder of the
stock, with the spices, herbs, shalots,
and onions, and simmer very gently for
1 hour. Strain and skim off every particle
of fat, and, when required for use,
thicken with butter and flour, or with
a little roux. Add the wine, and, if
necessary, a seasoning of cayenne; when
it will be ready to serve. <i>Time.</i>—1½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> per pint.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The wine in this sauce may be
omitted, and an onion sliced and fried of
a nice brown substituted for it. This
sauce or gravy is used for many dishes,
and with most people is a general
favourite.</p>

<h3>FISH.</h3>

<p>Fish shortly before they spawn are,
in general, best in condition. When
the spawning is just over, they are out
of season, and unfit for human food.</p>

<p>When fish is out of season, it has a
transparent, bluish tinge, however much
it may be boiled; whenever it is in season,
its muscles are firm, and boil white
and curdy.</p>

<p>As food for invalids, white fish, such
as the ling, cod, haddock, coal-fish, and
whiting, are the best; flat fish, as soles,
skate, turbot, and flounders, are also
good.</p>

<p>Salmon, mackerel, herrings, and trout
soon spoil or decompose after they are
killed; therefore, to be in perfection,
they should be prepared for the table
on the day they are caught. With flat
fish, this is not of such consequence, as
they will keep longer. The turbot, for
example, is improved by being kept for
a few hours.</p>


<h3>FISH, General Directions for
Dressing.</h3>

<p>In dressing fish of any kind, the first
point to be attended to, is to see that it
is perfectly clean. It is a common error
to wash it too much, as by doing so the
flavour is diminished. If the fish is to be
boiled, a little salt and vinegar should
be put into the water, to give it firmness,
after it is cleaned. Codfish, whiting,
and haddock, are none the worse for
being a little salted, and kept a day;
and, if the weather be not very hot, they
will be good for two days.</p>

<p>When fish is cheap and plentiful, and
a larger quantity is purchased than is
immediately wanted, the overplus of such
as will bear it should be potted, or
pickled, or salted, and hung up; or it
may be fried, that it may serve for stewing
the next day. Fresh-water fish,
having frequently a muddy smell and
taste, should be soaked in strong salt and
water, after it has been well cleaned. If
of a sufficient size, it may be scalded in
salt and water, and afterwards dried and
dressed.</p>

<p>Fish should be put into cold water and
set on the fire to do very gently, or the
outside will break before the inner part
is done. Unless the fishes are small,
they should never be put into warm
water; nor should water, either hot or
cold, be poured <i>on</i> to the fish, as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
liable to break the skin; if it should be
necessary to add a little water whilst the
fish is cooking, it ought to be poured in
gently at the side of the vessel. The
fish-plate may be drawn up, to see if the
fish be ready, which may be known by
its easily separating from the bone. It
should then be immediately taken out of
the water, or it will become woolly. The
fish-plate should be set crossways over
the kettle, to keep hot for serving, and
a cloth laid over the fish, to prevent its
losing its colour.</p>

<p>In garnishing fish great attention is
required, and plenty of parsley, horseradish,
and lemon should be used. If
fried parsley be used, it must be washed
and picked, and thrown into fresh water.
When the lard or dripping boils, throw
the parsley into it immediately from the
water, and instantly it will be green and
crisp, and must be taken up with a slice.
When well done, and with very good
sauce, fish is more appreciated than
almost any other dish. The liver and
roe, in some instances, should be placed
on the dish, in order that they may be
distributed in the course of serving; but
to each recipe will be appended the proper
mode of serving and garnishing.</p>

<p>If fish is to be fried or broiled it must
be dried in a nice soft cloth after it is
well cleaned and washed. If for frying,
brush it over with egg, and sprinkle it
with some fine crumbs of bread. If done
a second time with the egg and bread, the
fish will look so much the better. If required
to be very nice, a sheet of white
blotting-paper must be placed to receive
it, that it may be free from all grease;
it must also be of a beautiful colour, and
all the crumbs appear distinct. Butter
gives a bad colour; lard and clarified
dripping are most frequently used; but
oil is the best, if the expense be no
objection. The fish should be put into
the lard when boiling, and there should
be a sufficiency of this to cover it.</p>

<p>When fish is broiled, it must be seasoned,
floured, and laid on a very clean
gridiron, which, when hot, should be
rubbed with a bit of suet, to prevent the
fish from sticking. It must be broiled
over a very clear fire, that it may not
taste smoky; and not too near, that it
may not be scorched.</p>

<p>In choosing fish, it is well to remember
that it is possible it may be <i>fresh</i>, and
yet not <i>good</i>. Under the head of each
particular fish in this work, are appended
rules for its choice, and the months when
it is in season. Nothing can be of greater
consequence to a cook than to have the
fish good; as, if this important course in
a dinner does not give satisfaction, it is
rarely that the repast goes off well.</p>


<h3>FISH, General Directions for
Carving.</h3>

<p>In carving fish, care should be taken
to help it in perfect flakes, as, if these
are broken, the beauty of the fish is lost.
The carver should be acquainted, too, with
the choicest parts and morsels; and to
give each guest an equal share of these
<i>titbits</i> should be his maxim. Steel knives
and forks should on no account be used
in helping fish, as these are liable to
impart to it a very disagreeable flavour.
When silver fish-carvers are considered
too dear to be bought, good electro-plated
ones answer very well, and are
inexpensive.</p>


<h3>FISH CAKE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of any cold
fish, 1 onion, 1 faggot of sweet herbs;
salt and pepper to taste, 1 pint of water,
equal quantities of bread-crumbs and
cold potatoes, ½ teaspoonful of parsley,
1 egg, bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick the
meat from the bones of the fish, which
latter put, with the head and fins, into
a stewpan with the water; add pepper
and salt, the onion and herbs, and stew
slowly for gravy about 2 hours; chop
the fish fine, and mix it well with bread-crumbs
and cold potatoes, adding the
parsley and seasoning; make the whole
into a cake with the white of an egg,
brush it over with egg, cover with bread-crumbs,
fry of a light brown; strain the
gravy, pour it over, and stew gently for
¼ of an hour, stirring it carefully once or
twice. Serve hot, and garnish with thin
slices of lemon and parsley. <i>Time.</i>—½ an
hour after the gravy is made.</p>


<h3>FISH AND OYSTER PIE.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—Any
remains of cold fish, such as cod
or haddock; 2 dozen oysters, pepper
and salt to taste, bread-crumbs sufficient
for the quantity of fish; ½ teaspoonful of
grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of finely-chopped
parsley. <i>Mode.</i>—Clear the fish
from the bones, and put a layer of it in
a pie-dish, which sprinkle with pepper
and salt; then a layer of bread-crumbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
oysters, nutmeg, and chopped parsley.
Repeat this till the dish is quite full.
You may form a covering either of bread-crumbs,
which should be browned, or
puff-paste, which should be cut into long
strips, and laid in cross-bars over the
fish, with a line of the paste first laid
round the edge. Before putting on the
top, pour in some made melted butter,
or a little thin white sauce, and the
oyster-liquor, and bake. <i>Time.</i>—If made
of cooked fish, ¼ hour; if made of fresh
fish and puff-paste, ¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from September to
April.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A nice little dish may be made
by flaking any cold fish, adding a few
oysters, seasoning with pepper and salt,
and covering with mashed potatoes;
¼ hour will bake it.</p>


<h3>FISH PIE, with Tench and Eels.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 tench, 2 eels, 2 onions,
a faggot of herbs, 4 blades of mace,
3 anchovies, 1 pint of water, pepper and
salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of chopped

them into pieces 2 inches long, and leave
the sides of the tench whole. Put the
bones into a stewpan with the onions,
herbs, mace, anchovies, water, and seasoning,
and let them simmer gently for
1 hour. Strain it off, put it to cool, and
skim off all the fat. Lay the tench and
eels in a pie-dish, and between each layer
put seasoning, chopped parsley, and
hard-boiled eggs; pour in part of the
strained liquor, cover in with puff-paste,
and bake for ½ hour or rather more. The
oven should be rather quick, and when
done, heat the remainder of the liquor,
which pour into the pie. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour
to bake, or rather more if the oven is slow.</p>


<h3>FISH SAUCE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ oz. of cayenne, 2 tablespoonfuls
of walnut ketchup, 2 tablespoonfuls
of soy, a few shreds of garlic
and shalot, 1 quart of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
all the ingredients into a large
bottle, and shake well every day for a
fortnight. Keep it in small bottles well
sealed, and in a few days it will be fit
for use. <i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity, 1<i>s.</i></p>


<h3>FISH, Scalloped.</h3>

(these can be omitted), any kind of white
fish trimmings of fish which are to be
dressed for table, 2 onions, the rind of
½ a lemon, a bunch of sweet herbs, 2
carrots, 2 quarts of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
up the fish, and put it, with the other
ingredients, into the water. Simmer
for 2 hours; skim the liquor carefully,
and strain it. When a richer stock is
wanted, fry the vegetables and fish
before adding the water. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, with meat, 10<i>d.</i> per quart;
without, 3<i>d.</i></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Do not make fish stock long
before it is wanted, as it soon turns sour.</p>


<h3>FLOUNDERS, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sufficient water to cover
the flounders, salt in the proportion of
6 oz. to each gallon, a little vinegar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put on a kettle with enough
water to cover the flounders, lay in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
fish, add salt and vinegar in the above
proportions, and when it boils, simmer
very gently for 5 minutes. They must
not boil fast, or they will break. Serve
with plain melted butter, or parsley and
butter. <i>Time.</i>—After the water boils,
5 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i>
from August to November.</p>


<h3>FLOUNDERS, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Flounders, egg, and bread-crumbs;
boiling lard. <i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse
the fish, and, two hours before they are

and sprinkle over with bread-crumbs;
fry them in boiling lard, dish on a hot
napkin, and garnish with crisped parsley.
<i>Time.</i>—From 5 to 10 minutes, according
to size. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>d.</i> each.
<i>Seasonable</i> from August to November.
<i>Sufficient</i>, 1 for each person.</p>


<h3>FLOWERS, Almond.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Puff-paste; to every ½ lb.
of paste allow 3 oz. of almonds, sifted
sugar, the white of an egg. <i>Mode.</i>—Roll
the paste out to the thickness of ¼
inch, and, with a round fluted cutter,
stamp out as many pieces as may be required.
Work the paste up again, roll
it out, and, with a smaller cutter, stamp
out some pieces the size of a shilling.
Brush the larger pieces over with the
white of an egg, and place one of the
smaller pieces on each. Blanch and cut
the almonds into strips lengthwise; press
them slanting into the paste closely round
the rings; and when they are all completed,
sift over some pounded sugar,
and bake for about ¼ hour or twenty
minutes. Garnish between the almonds
with strips of apple jelly, and place in
centre of the ring a small quantity of
strawberry jam; pile them high on the
dish, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour or 20
minutes. <i>Sufficient.</i>—18 or 20 for a dish.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>FLOWERS, to Preserve Cut.</h3>

<p>A bouquet of freshly-cut flowers may
be preserved alive for a long time by
placing them in a glass or vase with fresh
water, in which a little charcoal has been
steeped, or a small piece of camphor
dissolved. The vase should be set upon
a plate or dish, and covered with a bell-glass,
around the edges of which, when
it comes in contact with the plate, a
little water should be poured to exclude
the air.</p>


<h3>FLOWERS, to Revive after Packing.</h3>

<p>Plunge the stems into boiling water,
and, by the time the water is cold, the
flowers will have revived. Then cut
afresh the ends of the stems, and keep
them in fresh cold water.</p>


<h3>FONDUE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, the weight of 2
in Parmesan or good Cheshire cheese, the
weight of 2 in butter; pepper and salt
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Separate the yolks
from the whites of the eggs; beat the
former in a basin, and grate the cheese,
or cut it into <i>very thin</i> flakes. Parmesan
or Cheshire cheese may be used, whichever
is the most convenient, although the
former is considered more suitable for
this dish; or an equal quantity of each
may be used. Break the butter into
small pieces, add to it the other ingredients,
with sufficient pepper and salt to
season nicely, and beat the mixture
thoroughly. Well whisk the whites of
the eggs, stir them lightly in, and either
bake the fondue in a soufflé-dish or small
round cake-tin. Fill the dish only half
full, as the fondue should rise very much.
Pin a napkin round the tin or dish, and
serve very hot and very quickly. If
allowed to stand after it is withdrawn
from the oven, the beauty and lightness
of this preparation will be entirely
spoiled. <i>Time.</i>—From 15 to 20 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>FONDUE, Brillat Savarin’s (an excellent
Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Eggs, cheese, butter,
pepper and salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Take the same
number of eggs as there are guests;
weigh the eggs in the shell, allow a third
of their weight in Gruyère cheese, and
a piece of butter one-sixth of the weight
of the cheese. Break the eggs into a
basin, beat them well; add the cheese,
which should be grated, and the butter,
which should be broken into small pieces.
Stir these ingredients together with a
wooden spoon; put the mixture into a
lined saucepan, place it over the fire, and
stir until the substance is thick and soft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Put in a little salt, according to the age
of the cheese, and a good sprinkling of
pepper, and serve the fondue on a very
hot silver or metal plate. Do not allow
the fondue to remain on the fire after the
mixture is set, as, if it boils, it will
be entirely spoiled. Brillat Savarin recommends
that some choice Burgundy
should be handed round with this dish.
We have given this recipe exactly as he
recommends it to be made; but we have
tried it with good Cheshire cheese, and
found it answer remarkably well. <i>Time.</i>—About
4 minutes to set the mixture.
<i>Average cost</i>, for 4 persons, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
1 egg, with the other ingredients
in proportion, for 1 person. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>FOOD FOR INFANTS, and its
Preparation.</h3>

<p>The articles generally employed as food
for infants consist of arrowroot, bread,
flour, baked flour, prepared groats, farinaceous
food, biscuit-powder, biscuits,
tops-and-bottoms, and semolina, or
manna croup, as it is otherwise called,
which, like tapioca, is the prepared pith
of certain vegetable substances. Of this
list the least efficacious, though, perhaps,
the most believed in, is arrowroot, which
only as a mere agent, for change, and
then only for a very short time, should
ever be employed as a means of diet to
infancy or childhood. It is a thin, flatulent,
and innutritious food, and incapable
of supporting infantine life and energy.
Bread, though the universal <i>régime</i> with
the labouring poor, where the infant’s
stomach and digestive powers are a reflex,
in miniature, of the father’s, should
never be given to an infant under three
months, and, even then, however finely
beaten up and smoothly made, is a very
questionable diet. Flour, when well
boiled, though infinitely better than
arrowroot, is still only a kind of fermentative
paste, that counteracts its
own good by after-acidity and flatulence.</p>

<p>Baked flour, when cooked into a pale
brown mass, and finely powdered, makes
a far superior food to the others, and
may be considered as a very useful diet,
especially for a change. Prepared groats
may be classed with arrowroot and raw
flour, as being innutritious. The articles
that now follow on our list are all good,
and such as we could, with conscience
and safety, trust to the health and development
of any child whatever.</p>

<p>We may observe in this place, that an
occasional change in the character of the
food is highly desirable, both as regards
the health and benefit of the child; and,
though the interruption should only
last for a day, the change will be advantageous.</p>

<p>The packets sold as farinaceous food
are unquestionably the best aliment that
can be given from the first to a baby, and
may be continued, with the exception of
an occasional change, without alteration
of the material, till the child is able to
take its regular meals of animal and
vegetable food. Some infants are so
constituted as to require a frequent and
a total change in their system of living,
seeming to thrive for a certain time on
any food given to them, but if persevered
in too long, declining in bulk and appearance
as rapidly as they had previously
progressed. In such cases, the food
should be immediately changed, and
when that which appeared to agree best
with the child is resumed, it should be
altered in its quality, and perhaps in its
consistency.</p>

<p>For the farinaceous food there are
directions with each packet, containing
instructions for the making; but, whatever
the food employed is, enough should
be made at once to last the day and
night; at first, about a pint basinful,
but, as the child advances, a quart will
hardly be too much. In all cases, let
the food boil a sufficient time, constantly
stirring, and taking every precaution
that it does not get burnt, in which case
it is on no account to be used.</p>

<p>The food should always be made with
water, the whole sweetened at once, and
of such a consistency that, when poured
out, and it has had time to cool, it will
cut with the firmness of a pudding or
custard. One or two spoonfuls are to be
put into the pap saucepan and stood on
the hob till the heat has softened it,
when enough milk is to be added, and
carefully mixed with the food, till the
whole has the consistency of ordinary
cream; it is then to be poured into the
nursing-bottle, and the food having been
drawn through to warm the nipple, it is
to be placed in the child’s mouth. For
the first month or more, half a bottleful
will be quite enough to give the infant
at one time; but, as the child grows, it
will be necessary not only to increase the
quantity given at each time, but also
gradually to make its food more consistent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and, after the third month, to
add an egg to every pint basin of food
made. At night, the mother puts the
food into the covered pan of her lamp,
instead of the saucepan—that is, enough
for one supply, and, having lighted the
rush, she will find, on the waking of her
child, the food sufficiently hot to bear
the cooling addition of the milk. But,
whether night or day, the same food
should never be heated twice, and what
the child leaves should be thrown away.</p>

<p>The biscuit powder is used in the same
manner as the farinaceous food, and both
prepared much after the fashion of
making starch. But when tops-and-bottoms,
or the whole biscuit, are employed,
they require soaking in cold
water for some time previously to boiling.
The biscuit or biscuits are then to be
slowly boiled in as much water as will,
when thoroughly soft, allow of their
being beaten by a three-pronged fork
into a fine, smooth, and even pulp, and
which, when poured into a basin and
become cold, will cut out like a custard.
If two large biscuits have been so treated,
and the child is six or seven months old,
beat up two eggs, sufficient sugar to properly
sweeten it, and about a pint of
skim milk. Pour this on the beaten
biscuit in the saucepan, stirring constantly;
boil for about five minutes, pour
into a basin, and use, when cold, in the
same manner as the other.</p>

<p>This makes an admirable food, at once
nutritious and strengthening. When
tops-and-bottoms or rusks are used, the
quantity of the egg may be reduced, or
altogether omitted.</p>

<p>Semolina, or manna croup, being in
little hard grains, like a fine millet-seed,
must be boiled for some time, and the
milk, sugar, and egg added to it on the
fire, and boiled for a few minutes longer,
and, when cold, used as the other preparations.</p>

<p>Many persons entertain a belief that
cow’s milk is hurtful to infants, and,
consequently, refrain from giving it;
but this is a very great mistake, for both
sugar and milk should form a large portion
of every meal an infant takes.</p>


<h3><a id="FORCEMEATS"></a>FORCEMEATS.</h3>

<p>The points which cooks should, in this
branch of cookery, more particularly
observe, are the thorough chopping of
the suet, the complete mincing of the
herbs, the careful grating of the bread-crumbs,
and the perfect mixing of the
whole. These are the three principal
ingredients of forcemeats, and they can
scarcely be cut too small, as nothing like
a lump or fibre should be anywhere
perceptible. To conclude, the flavour of
no one spice or herb should be permitted
to predominate.</p>


<h3>FORCEMEAT BALLS, for Fish
Soups.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 middling-sized lobster,
½ an anchovy, 1 head of boiled celery,
the yolk of a hard-boiled egg; salt,
cayenne, and mace to taste; 4 tablespoonfuls
of bread-crumbs, 2 oz. of
butter, 2 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick the meat
from the shell of the lobster, and pound
it, with the soft parts, in a mortar; add
the celery, the yolk of the hard-boiled
egg, seasoning, and bread-crumbs. Continue
pounding till the whole is nicely
amalgamated. Warm the butter till it
is in a liquid state; well whisk the eggs,
and work these up with the pounded
lobster-meat. Make the balls of about
an inch in diameter, and fry of a nice pale
brown. <i>Sufficient</i>, from 18 to 20 balls for
1 tureen of soup.</p>


<h3>FORCEMEAT, French.</h3>

<p>It will be well to state, in the beginning
of this recipe, that French forcemeat, or
quenelles, consist of the blending of three
separate processes; namely, panada,
udder, and whatever meat you intend
using.</p>

<p><b>Panada.</b> <i>Ingredients.</i>—The crumb
of 2 penny rolls, 4 tablespoonfuls of
white stock, 1 oz. of butter, 1 slice of
ham, 1 bay-leaf, a little minced parsley,
2 shalots, 1 clove, 2 blades of mace, a
few mushrooms, butter, the yolks of 2
eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Soak the crumb of the
rolls in milk for about ½ hour, then take
it out, and squeeze so as to press the
milk from it; put the soaked bread into
a stewpan with the above quantity of
white stock, and set it on one side; then
put into a separate stewpan 1 oz. of
butter, a slice of lean ham cut small, with
a bay-leaf, herbs, mushrooms, spices,
&amp;c., in the above proportions, and fry
them gently over a slow fire. When
done, moisten with 2 teacupfuls of white
stock, boil for 20 minutes, and strain the
whole through a sieve over the panada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in the other stewpan. Place it over the
fire, keep constantly stirring, to prevent
its burning, and, when quite dry, put in
a small piece of butter. Let this again
dry up by stirring over the fire; then
add the yolks of 2 eggs, mix well, put
the panada to cool on a clean plate, and
use it when required. Panada should
always be well flavoured, as the forcemeat
receives no taste from any of the
other ingredients used in its preparation.</p>

<p><b>Boiled Calf’s Udder for French
Forcemeat.</b>—Put the udder into a
stewpan with sufficient water to cover it;
let it stew gently till quite done, when
take it out to cool. Trim all the upper
parts, cut it into small pieces, and pound
well in a mortar, till it can be rubbed
through a sieve. That portion which
passes through the strainer is one of the
three ingredients of which French forcemeats
are generally composed; but many
cooks substitute butter for this, being a
less troublesome and more expeditious
mode of preparation.</p>


<h3>FORCEMEAT, for Cold Savoury
Pies.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of veal, 1 lb. of fat
bacon; salt, cayenne, pepper, and
pounded mace to taste; a very little
nutmeg, the same of chopped lemon-peel,
½ teaspoonful of chopped parsley, ½ teaspoonful
of minced savoury herbs, 1 or 2
eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Chop the veal and bacon
together, and put them into a mortar with
the other ingredients mentioned above.
Pound well, and bind with 1 or 2 eggs
which have been previously beaten and
strained. Work the whole well together,
and the forcemeat will be ready for use.
If the pie is not to be eaten immediately,
omit the herbs and parsley, as these will
prevent it from keeping. Mushrooms or
truffles may be added. <i>Sufficient</i> for 2
small pies.</p>


<h3>FORCEMEAT, for Pike, Carp, Haddock,
and various Kinds of Fish.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 oz. of fresh butter, 1 oz.
of suet, 1 oz. of fat bacon, 1 small teaspoonful
of minced savoury herbs, including
parsley; a little onion, when
liked, shredded very fine; salt, nutmeg,
and cayenne to taste; 4 oz. of bread-crumbs,
1 egg. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix all the ingredients
well together, carefully mincing
them very finely; beat up the egg,
moisten with it, and work the whole very
smoothly together. Oysters or anchovies
may be added to this forcemeat, and will
be found a great improvement. <i>Average
cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a moderate-sized
haddock or pie.</p>


<h3>FORCEMEAT, for Baked Pike.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 oz. of bread-crumbs,
1 teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs,
8 oysters, 2 anchovies (these may be dispensed
with), 2 oz. of suet; salt, pepper,
and pounded mace to taste; 6 tablespoonfuls
of cream or milk, the yolks of
2 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Beard and mince the
oysters, prepare and mix the other ingredients,
and blend the whole thoroughly
together. Moisten with the cream and
eggs, put all into a stewpan, and stir it
over the fire till it thickens, when put it
into the fish, which should have previously
been cut open, and sew it up.
<i>Time.</i>—4 or 5 minutes to thicken. <i>Average
cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a moderate-sized
pike.</p>


<h3>FORCEMEAT, or QUENELLES,
for Turtle Soup. (Soyer’s Recipe.)</h3>

<p>Take a pound and a half of lean veal
from the fillet, and cut it in long thin
slices; scrape with a knife till nothing
but the fibre remains; put it into a mortar,
pound it 10 minutes, or until in a
purée; pass it through a wire sieve (use
the remainder in stock); then take 1
pound of good fresh beef suet, which
skin, shred, and chop very fine; put it
into a mortar and pound it; then add
6 oz. of panada (that is, bread soaked in
milk and boiled till nearly dry) with the
suet; pound them well together, and
add the veal; season with a teaspoonful
of salt, a quarter one of pepper, half
that of nutmeg; work all well together;
then add four eggs by degrees, continually
pounding the contents of the mortar.
When well mixed, take a small piece in
a spoon, and poach it in some boiling
water; and if it is delicate, firm, and of
a good flavour, it is ready for use.</p>


<h3>FORCEMEAT VEAL, or VEAL
QUENELLES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Equal quantities of veal,
panada, and calf’s udder, 2 eggs; seasoning
to taste of pepper, salt, and
pounded mace, or grated nutmeg; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
little flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Take the fleshy
part of veal, scrape it with a knife, till
all the meat is separated from the sinews,
and allow about ½ lb. for an entrée.
Chop the meat, and pound it in a mortar
till reduced to a paste; then roll it into
a ball; make another of panada the same
size, and another of udder, taking care
that these three balls be of the same
size. (It is to be remembered, that equality
of <i>size</i>, and not of weight, is here
necessary.) When the three ingredients
are properly prepared, pound them altogether
in a mortar for some time; for
the more quenelles are pounded, the
more delicate they are. Now moisten
with the eggs, whites and yolks, and
continue pounding, adding a seasoning
of pepper, spices, &amp;c. When the whole
is well blended together, mould it into
balls, or whatever shape is intended,
roll them in flour, and poach in boiling
water, to which a little salt should have
been added. If the quenelles are not
firm enough, add the yolk of another
egg, but omit the white, which only
makes them hollow and puffy inside.
In the preparation of this recipe, it
would be well to bear in mind that the
ingredients are to be well pounded and
seasoned, and must be made hard or soft
according to the dishes they are intended
for. For brown or white ragoûts they
should be firm, and when the quenelles
are used very small, extreme delicacy
will be necessary in their preparation.
Their flavour may be varied by using the
flesh of rabbit, fowl, hare, pheasant,
grouse, or an extra quantity of mushroom,
parsley, &amp;c.</p>


<h3>FORCEMEAT for Veal, Turkeys,
Fowls, Hare, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 oz. of ham or lean
bacon, ¼ lb. of suet, the rind of half a
lemon, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley,
1 teaspoonful of minced sweet herbs;
salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to taste;
6 oz. of bread-crumbs, 2 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Shred
the ham or bacon, chop the suet,
lemon-peel, and herbs, taking particular
care that all be very finely minced; add
a seasoning to taste of salt, cayenne,
and mace, and blend all thoroughly together
with the bread-crumbs, before
wetting. Now beat and strain the eggs;
work these up with the other ingredients,
and the forcemeat will be ready for use.
When it is made into balls, fry of a nice
brown, in boiling lard, or put them on a
tin and bake for ½ hour in a moderate
oven. As we have stated before, no one
flavour should predominate greatly, and
the forcemeat should be of sufficient
body to cut with a knife, and yet not
dry and heavy. For very delicate forcemeat,
it is advisable to pound the ingredients
together before binding with the
eggs; but for ordinary cooking, mincing
very finely answers the purpose. <i>Average
cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a turkey, a
moderate-sized fillet of veal, or a hare.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—In the forcemeat for Hare, the
liver of the animal is sometimes added.
Boil for 5 minutes, mince it very small,
and mix it with the other ingredients.
If it should be in an unsound state, it
must be on no account made use of.</p>


<h3>FOWLS, Boiled, à la Béchamel.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A pair of fowls, 1 pint of
Béchamel, a few bunches of boiled broccoli
or cauliflower. <i>Mode.</i>—Truss and boil
the flowers; make a pint of Béchamel
sauce; pour some of this over the fowls,
and the remainder send to table in a
tureen. Garnish the dish with bunches
of boiled cauliflowers or broccoli, and
serve very hot. The sauce should be
made sufficiently thick to adhere to the
fowls; that for the tureen should be
thinned by adding a spoonful or two of
stock. <i>Time.</i>—From ½ to 1 hour, according
to size. <i>Average cost</i>, in full
season, 5<i>s.</i> a pair. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year, but
scarce in early spring.</p>


<h3>FOWLS, Boiled, to Carve.</h3>

<div class="caption">LEG, WING, AND
NECKBONE OF FOWL.</div>
</div>

<p>This will not be found a very difficult
member of the poultry family to carve,
unless, as may happen, a very old farm-yard
occupant, useless for egg-laying
purposes, has,
by some unlucky
mischance, been
introduced into
the kitchen as
a “fine young
chicken.” Skill,
however, and
the application of a small amount of
strength, combined with a fine keeping
of the temper, will even get over that difficulty.
Fixing the fork firmly in the
breast, let the knife be firmly passed
along the line shown from 1 to 2; then
cut downwards from that line to fig. 3:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and the wing, it will be found, can be
easily withdrawn. The shape of the
wing should be like the accompanying
engraving. Let the fork be placed inside
the leg, which
should be gently
forced away from
the body of the
fowl; and the
joint, being thus
discovered, the
carver can readily
cut through it, and
the leg can be
served. When the
leg is displaced, it
should be of the
same shape as that
shown in the annexed
woodcut.
The legs and
wings on either
side having been taken off, the carver
should draw his knife through the flesh
in the direction of the line 4 to 5; by
this means the knife can be slipped
underneath the merrythought, which,
being lifted up and pressed backward,
will immediately come off. The collar- or
neck-bones are the next to consider:
these lie on each side of the merrythought,
close under the upper part of
the wings; and, in order to free these
from the fowl, they must also be raised
by the knife at their broad end, and
turned from the body towards the breastbone,
until the shorter piece of the bone,
as shown in the cut, breaks off. There will
now be left only the breast, with the
ribs. The breast can be, without difficulty,
disengaged from the ribs by cutting
through the latter, which will offer
little impediment. The side bones are
now to be taken off; and to do this, the
lower end of the back should be turned
from the carver, who should press the
point of the knife through the top of the
backbone, near the centre, bringing it
down towards the end of the back completely
through the bone. If the knife
be now turned in the opposite direction,
the joint will be easily separated from
the vertebræ. The backbone being
now uppermost, the fork should be
pressed firmly down on it, whilst at
the same time the knife should be
employed in raising up the lower small
end of the fowl towards the fork, and
thus the back will be dislocated about
its middle. The wings, breast, and
merrythought are esteemed the prime
parts of a fowl, and are usually served
to the ladies of the company, to whom
legs, except as a matter of paramount
necessity, should not be given. Byron
gave it as one reason why he did not
like dining with ladies, that they always
had the wings of the fowls, which he
himself preferred. We heard a gentleman
who, when he might have had a
wing, declare his partiality for a leg,
saying that he had been obliged to eat
legs for so long a time that he had at
last come to like them better than the
other more prized parts. If the fowl is,
capon-like, very large, slices may be
carved from its breast in the same manner
as from a turkey’s.</p>


<h3>FOWL, Boiled, with Oysters.
(Excellent.)</h3>

it boiling for 1½ hour, or rather longer;
then take the gravy that has flowed from
the oysters and fowl, of which there will
be a good quantity; stir in the cream
and yolks of eggs, add a few oysters
scalded in their liquor; let the sauce get
quite <i>hot</i>, but do not allow it to <i>boil</i>;
pour some of it over the fowl, and the
remainder send to table in a tureen. A

<h3>FOWLS, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A pair of fowls, a little
flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Fowls, to be tender, should
be killed a couple of days before they are
dressed; when the feathers come out
easily; then let them be picked and
cooked. In drawing them be careful not
to break the gall-bag, as, wherever it
touches, it would impart a very bitter
taste; the liver and gizzard should also
be preserved. Truss them in the following
manner:—After having carefully
picked them, cut off the head, and skewer
the skin of the neck down over the back.
Cut off the claws, dip the legs in boiling
water, and scrape them; turn the pinions
under, run a skewer through them and
the middle of the legs, which should be
passed through the body to the pinion
and leg on the other side, one skewer
securing the limbs on both sides. The
liver and gizzard should be placed in the
wings, the liver on one side and the gizzard
on the other. Tie the legs together
by passing a trussing-needle, threaded
with twine, through the backbone, and
secure it on the other side. If trussed
like a capon, the legs are placed more
apart. When firmly trussed, singe them
all over; put them down to a bright clear
fire, paper the breasts with a sheet of
buttered paper, and keep the fowls well
basted. Roast them for ¾ hour, more or
less, according to the size, and 10 minutes
before serving, remove the paper, dredge
the fowls with a little fine flour, put a
piece of butter into the basting-ladle, and
as it melts baste the fowls with it; when
nicely frothed and of a rich colour, serve
with good brown gravy (a little of which
should be poured over the fowls), and a
tureen of well-made bread sauce. Mushroom,
oyster, or egg sauce, are very suitable
accompaniments to roast fowl.—Chicken
is roasted in the same manner.
<i>Time.</i>—A very large fowl, quite 1 hour;
a medium-sized one, ¾ hour; chicken,
½ hour, or rather longer. <i>Average cost</i>,
in full season, 5<i>s.</i> a pair; when scarce,
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the pair. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year, but scarce
in early spring.</p>

<h3>FOWL, Roast, to Carve.</h3>

<p>A roast fowl is carved in the same
manner as a boiled fowl, viz., by cutting
along the line from 1 to 2, and then round
the leg between it and the wing. The
markings and detached pieces, as shown
in the engravings under the heading of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
“Boiled Fowl,” supersede the necessity
of our lengthily again describing the operation.
It
may be added,
that the
liver, being
considered a
delicacy,
should be divided, and one half served
with each wing. In the case of a fowl
being stuffed, it will be proper to give
each guest a portion, unless it be not
agreeable to some one of the party.</p>

<h3>FRENCH TERMS used in modern
Household Cookery, explained.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Aspic.</span>—A savoury jelly, used as an
exterior moulding for cold game, poultry,
fish, &amp;c. This, being of a transparent
nature, allows the article which it covers
to be seen through it. This may also be
used for decorating or garnishing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Assiettes_volantes"></a>Assiette</span> (plate).—<i>Assiettes</i> are the
small <i>entrées</i> and <i>hors-d’œuvres</i>, the
quantity of which does not exceed what
a plate will hold. At dessert, fruits,
cheese, chestnuts, biscuits, &amp;c., if served
upon a plate, are termed <i>assiettes</i>.—<span class="smcap">Assiette
volante</span> is a dish which a servant
hands round to the guests, but is
not placed upon the table. Small cheese
soufflés and different dishes, which ought
to be served very hot, are frequently
made <i>assiettes volantes</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Au-bleu.</span>—Fish dressed in such a

<p><span class="smcap">Bain-marie.</span>—An open saucepan or
kettle of nearly boiling water, in which
a smaller vessel can be set for cooking
and warming. This is very useful for
keeping articles hot, without altering
their quantity or quality. If you keep
sauce, broth, or soup by the fireside, the
soup reduces and becomes too strong,
and the sauce thickens as well as reduces;
but this is prevented by using
the <i>bain-marie</i>, in which the water should
be very hot, but not boiling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Béchamel.</span>—French white sauce, now
frequently used in English cookery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanch.</span>—To whiten poultry, vegetables,

<h3>FRITTERS, Indian.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 tablespoonfuls of flour,
boiling water, the yolks of 4 eggs, the
whites of 2, hot lard or clarified dripping,
jam. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the flour into a basin,
and pour over it sufficient <i>boiling</i> water
to make it into a stiff paste, taking care
to stir and beat it well, to prevent it
getting lumpy. Leave it a little time to
cool, and then break into it (<i>without
beating them at first</i>) the yolks of 4 eggs
and the whites of 2, and stir and beat all
well together. Have ready some boiling
lard or butter; drop a dessertspoonful of
batter in at a time, and fry the fritters
of a light brown. They should rise so
much as to be almost like balls. Serve
on a dish, with a spoonful of preserve or
marmalade dropped in between each
fritter. This is an excellent dish for a
hasty addition to dinner, if a guest unexpectedly
arrives, it being so easily and
quickly made, and it is always a great
favourite. <i>Time.</i>—From 5 to 8 minutes
to fry the fritters. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the jam, 5<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>FRITTERS, Plain.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 oz. of flour, 3 eggs, 1/3
pint of milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the flour to a
smooth batter with a small quantity of
the milk; stir in the eggs, which should
be well whisked, and then the remainder
of the milk; beat the whole to a perfectly
smooth batter, and should it be
found not quite thin enough, add two or
three tablespoonfuls more milk. Have
ready a frying-pan, with plenty of boiling
lard in it; drop in rather more than
a tablespoonful at a time of the batter
and fry the fritters a nice brown, turning
them when sufficiently cooked on one
side. Drain them well from the greasy
moisture by placing them upon a piece
of blotting-paper before the fire; dish
them on a white d’oyley, sprinkle over
them sifted sugar, and send to table
with them a cut lemon and plenty of
pounded sugar. <i>Time.</i>—From 6 to 8 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
3 or 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>FRUIT, to Bottle Fresh. (Very
useful in Winter.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Fresh fruits, such as
currants, raspberries, cherries, gooseberries,
plums of all kinds, damsons,
&amp;c.; wide-mouthed glass bottles, new
corks to fit them tightly. <i>Mode.</i>—Let
the fruit be full grown, but not too ripe,
and gathered in dry weather. Pick it off
the stalks without bruising or breaking
the skin, and reject any that is at all
blemished: if gathered in the damp, or
if the skins are cut at all, the fruit will
mould. Have ready some <i>perfectly dry</i>
glass bottles, and some nice <i>new</i> soft
corks or bungs; burn a match in each
bottle, to exhaust the air, and quickly
place the fruit in to be preserved; gently
cork the bottles, and put them in a very
cool oven, where let them remain until the
fruit has shrunk away a fourth part. Then
take the bottles out; <i>do not open them</i>,
but immediately beat the corks in tight,
cut off the tops, and cover them with
melted resin. If kept in a dry place, the
fruit will remain good for months; and
on this principally depends the success
of the preparation; for if stored away in
a place that is in the least damp, the
fruit will soon spoil. <i>Time.</i>—From 5 to
6 hours in a very slow oven.</p>


<h3>FRUIT, to Bottle Fresh.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Any kind of fresh fruit,
such as currants, cherries, gooseberries,
all kinds of plums, &amp;c.; wide-mouthed
glass bottles, new corks to fit them
tightly. <i>Mode.</i>—the fruit must be full-grown,
not too ripe, and gathered on a
fine day. Let it be carefully picked and
put into the bottles, which must be clean
and perfectly dry. Tie over the tops of
the bottles pieces of bladder; stand the
bottles in a large pot, copper, or boiler,
with cold water to reach to their necks;
kindle a fire under, let the water boil,
and as the bladders begin to rise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
puff, prick them. As soon as the water
boils, extinguish the fire, and let the
bottles remain where they are, to become
cold. The next day remove the bladders,
and strew over the fruit a thick
layer of pounded sugar; fit the bottles
with cork, and let each cork lie close at
hand to its own bottle. Hold for a few
moments, in the neck of the bottle, two
or three lighted matches, and when they
have filled the bottle neck with gas, and
before they go out, remove them very
quickly; instantly cork the bottle closely,
and dip it in bottle-cement. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether
about 8 hours.</p>


<h3>FRUIT, to Bottle Fresh, with
Sugar. (Very useful in Winter.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Any kind of fresh fruit;
to each quart bottle allow ¼ lb. of pounded
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the fruit be gathered
in dry weather. Pick it carefully,
and drop it into <i>clean</i> and <i>very dry</i> quart
glass bottles, sprinkling over it the above
proportion of pounded sugar to each
quart. Put the corks in the bottles, and
place them in a copper of cold water up
to their necks, with small hay-wisps
round them, to prevent the bottles from
knocking together. Light the fire under,
bring the water gradually to boil, and let
it simmer gently until the fruit in the
bottles is reduced nearly one third. Extinguish
the fire, <i>and let the bottles remain
in the water until it is perfectly cold</i>; then
take them out, make the corks secure,
and cover them with melted resin or wax.
<i>Time.</i>—About ½ hour from the time the
water commences to boil.</p>


<h3>FRUIT TURNOVERS (suitable
for Pic-Nics).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Puff-paste, any kind of
fruit, sugar to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
some puff-paste by recipe; roll it out to
the thickness of about ¼ inch, and cut it
out in pieces of a circular form; pile the
fruit on half of the paste, sprinkle over
some sugar, wet the edges and turn the
paste over. Press the edges together,
ornament them, and brush the turnovers
over with the white of an egg; sprinkle
over sifted sugar, and bake on tins, in a
brisk oven, for about 20 minutes. Instead of
putting the fruit in raw, it may
be boiled down with a little sugar first,
and then inclosed in the crust; or jam,
of any kind, may be substituted for fresh
fruit. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes. <i>Sufficient.</i>—½
lb. of puff-paste will make a dozen turnovers.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>GAME, Hashed.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold game, 1 onion
stuck with 3 cloves, a few whole peppers,
a strip of lemon-peel, salt to taste,
thickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of
port wine, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice,
1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1 pint
of water or weak stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the
remains of cold game into joints, reserve
the best pieces, and the inferior ones
and trimmings put into a stewpan with
the onion, pepper, lemon-peel, salt, and
water or weak stock; stew these for
about an hour, and strain the gravy;
thicken it with butter and flour; add the
wine, lemon-juice, and ketchup; lay in
the pieces of game, and let them gradually
warm through by the side of the
fire; do not allow it to boil, or the game
will be hard. When on the point of
simmering, serve, and garnish the dish
with sippets of toasted bread. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether
1¼ hour. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Any kind of game may be
hashed by the above recipe, and the flavour
may be varied by adding flavoured
vinegars, curry powder, &amp;c.; but we
cannot recommend these latter ingredients,
as a dish of game should really
have a gamy taste; and if too many
sauces, essences, &amp;c., are added to the
gravy, they quite overpower and destroy
the flavour the dish should possess.</p>


<h3>GERMAN PUFFS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 oz. of flour, 2 eggs, ½
pint of new milk, 2 oz. of melted butter,
little salt and nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the
2 eggs be well beaten, then mix all the ingredients
well together, and heat them
up just before they are put into little
cups half full for baking. Bake for ¼
hour in a hot oven till the puffs are of a
nice brown; turn out on a flat dish, rub
a little butter over each puff, and dust
on it powdered sugar. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>GHERKINS, Pickled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Salt and water, 1 oz. of
bruised ginger ½ oz. of whole black
pepper, ¼ oz. of whole allspice, 4 cloves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
2 blades of mace, a little horseradish.
This proportion of pepper, spices, &amp;c.,
for 1 quart of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the
gherkins remain in salt and water for 3
or 4 days, when take them out, wipe
perfectly dry, and put them into a stone
jar. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover
them, with spices and pepper, &amp;c., in
the above proportion, for 10 minutes;
pour it, quite boiling, over the gherkins,
cover the jar with vine-leaves, and
put over them a plate, setting them near
the fire, where they must remain all
night. Next day drain off the vinegar,
boil it up again, and pour it hot over
them. Cover up with fresh leaves, and
let the whole remain till quite cold. Now
tie down closely with bladder to exclude
the air, and in a month or two they
will be fit for use. <i>Time.</i>—4 days. <i>Seasonable</i>
from the middle of July to the
end of August.</p>


<h3>GIBLET PIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A set of duck or goose
giblets, 1 lb. of rump-steak, 1 onion, ½

pieces; line the bottom of a pie-dish
with a few pieces of rump-steak; add a
layer of giblets and a few more pieces of
steak; season with pepper and salt, and
pour in the gravy (which should be
strained), that the giblets were stewed
in; cover with a plain crust, and bake
for rather more than 1½ hour in a brisk
oven. Cover a piece of paper over the
pie, to prevent the crust taking too
much colour. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour to stew
the giblets, about 1 hour to bake the

in 8 pieces, and put them in a stewpan
with the beef, bones, ox-tail, mutton-shanks,
onions, herbs, pepper, and
salt; add the 3 quarts of water, and
simmer till the giblets are tender, taking
care to skim well. When the giblets are
done, take them out, put them in your
tureen, strain the soup through a sieve,
add the cream and butter, mixed with a
dessertspoonful of flour, boil it up for a
few minutes, and pour it over the giblets.
It can be flavoured with port wine
and a little mushroom ketchup, instead
of cream. Add salt to taste. <i>Time.</i>—3
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per quart.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 10
persons.</p>


<h3>GINGER, Apple. (A Dessert Dish.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of any kind of hard
apples, 2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 1½ pint of
water, 1 oz. of tincture of ginger. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the sugar and water until they
form a rich syrup, adding the ginger
when it boils up. Pare, core, and cut
the apples into pieces; dip them in cold
water to preserve the colour, and boil
them in the syrup until transparent; but
be careful not to let them break. Put
the pieces of apple into jars, pour over
the syrup, and carefully exclude the air,
by well covering them. It will remain
good some time, if kept in a dry place.
<i>Time.</i>—From 5 to 10 minutes to boil the
syrup; about ½ hour to simmer the
apples. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 7
or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in
September, October, or November.</p>


<h3>GINGER-BEER.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2½ lbs. of loaf sugar, 1½
oz. of bruised ginger, 1 oz. of cream of
tartar, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, 3
gallons of boiling water, two large tablespoonfuls
of thick and fresh brewer’s
yeast. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel the lemons, squeeze
the juice, strain it, and put the peel and
juice into a large earthen pan, with the
bruised ginger, cream of tartar, and loaf
sugar. Put over these ingredients 3
gallons of <i>boiling</i> water; let it stand
until just warm, when add the yeast,
which should be thick and perfectly
fresh. Stir the contents of the pan well,
and let them remain near the fire all
night, covering the pan over with a
cloth. The next day skim off the yeast,
and pour the liquor carefully into another
vessel, leaving the sediment; then bottle
immediately, and tie the corks down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and in 3 days the ginger-beer will be fit
for use. For some tastes, the above
proportion of sugar may be found rather
too large, when it may be diminished;
but the beer will not keep so long good.
<i>Average cost</i> for this quantity, 2<i>s.</i>; or ½<i>d.</i>
per bottle. <i>Sufficient</i> to fill 4 dozen
ginger-beer bottles. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This
should be made during the summer
months.</p>


<h3>GINGER CREAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The yolks of 4 eggs, 1
pint of cream, 3 oz. of preserved ginger,
2 dessertspoonfuls of syrup, sifted sugar
to taste, 1 oz. of isinglass. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice
the ginger finely; put it into a
basin with the syrup, the well-beaten
yolks of eggs, and the cream; mix these
ingredients well together, and stir them
over the fire for about 10 minutes, or
until the mixture thickens; then take it
off the fire, whisk till nearly cold,
sweeten to taste, add the isinglass,
which should be melted and strained,
and serve the cream in a glass dish. It
may be garnished with slices of preserved
ginger or candied citron. <i>Time.</i>—About
10 minutes to stir the cream
over the fire. <i>Average cost</i>, with cream
at 1<i>s.</i> per pint, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a
good-sized dish. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>GINGER, Preserved,</h3>

<p>Comes from the West Indies. It is
made by scalding the roots when they
are green and full of sap, then peeling
them in cold water and putting them
into jars, with a rich syrup; in which
state we receive them. It should be
chosen of a deep yellow colour, with a
little transparency. What is dark-coloured,
fibrous, and stringy, is not good.
Ginger roots, fit for preserving and in size
equal to West Indian, have been produced
in the Royal Agricultural Garden
in Edinburgh.</p>


<h3>GINGER PUDDING.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of flour, ¼ lb. of
suet, ¼ lb. of moist sugar, 2 large teaspoonfuls
of grated ginger. <i>Mode.</i>—Shred
the suet very fine, mix it with the
flour, sugar, and ginger; stir all well
together; butter a basin, and put the
mixture in dry; tie a cloth over, and
boil for 3 hours. <i>Time.</i>—3 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>GINGER WINE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To 9 gallons of water
allow 27 lbs. of loaf sugar, 9 lemons, 12
oz. of bruised ginger, 3 tablespoonfuls of
yeast, 2 lbs. of raisins stoned and chopped,
1 pint of brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
together for 1 hour in a copper (let it
previously be well scoured and beautifully
clean) the water, sugar, <i>lemon-rinds</i>,
and bruised ginger; remove every particle
of scum as it rises, and when the
liquor is sufficiently boiled, put it into a
large tub or pan, as it must not remain
in the copper. When nearly cold, add
the yeast, which must be thick and very
fresh, and, the next day, put all in a
dry cask with the strained lemon-juice
and chopped raisins. Stir the wine every
day for a fortnight; then add the
brandy, stop the cask down by degrees,
and in a few weeks it will be fit to bottle.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> per gallon. <i>Sufficient</i>
to make 9 gallons of wine. <i>Seasonable.</i>—The
best time for making this wine is
either in March or September.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Wine made early in March will
be fit to bottle in June.</p>


<h3>GINGERBREAD, Thick.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of treacle, ¼ lb. of
butter, ¼ lb. of coarse brown sugar, 1½
lb. of flour, 1 oz. of ginger, ½ oz. of
ground allspice, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate
of soda, ¼ pint of warm milk, 3 eggs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the flour into a basin, with
the sugar, ginger, and allspice; mix
these together; warm the butter, and
add it, with the treacle, to the other
ingredients. Stir well; make the milk
just warm, dissolve the carbonate of soda
in it, and mix the whole into a nice
smooth dough with the eggs, which
should be previously well whisked; pour
the mixture into a buttered tin, and
bake it from ¾ to 1 hour, or longer,
should the gingerbread be very thick.
Just before it is done, brush the top
over with the yolk of an egg beaten up
with a little milk, and put it back in the
oven to finish baking. <i>Time.</i>—¾ to 1
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per square. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>GINGERBREAD, White.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ½ lb. of
butter, ½ lb. of loaf sugar, the rind of 1
lemon, 1 oz. of ground ginger, 1 nutmeg
grated, ½ teaspoonful of carbonate of
soda, 1 gill of milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
butter into the flour; add the sugar,
which should be finely pounded and sifted,
and the minced lemon-rind, ginger,
and nutmeg. Mix these well together;
make the milk just warm, stir in the
soda, and work the whole into a nice
smooth paste; roll it out, cut it into
cakes, and bake in a moderate oven
from 15 to 20 minutes. <i>Time.</i>—15 to 20
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>GINGERBREAD-NUTS, Rich
Sweetmeats.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of treacle, ¼ lb. of
clarified butter, 1 lb. of coarse brown
sugar, 2 oz. of ground ginger, 1 oz. of
candied orange-peel, 1 oz. of candied angelica,
½ oz. of candied lemon-peel, ½ oz.
of coriander seeds, ½ oz. of caraway
seeds, 1 egg; flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the
treacle into a basin, and pour over it the
butter, melted so as not to oil, the sugar,
and ginger. Stir these ingredients well
together, and whilst mixing, add the
candied peel, which should be cut into
very small pieces, but not bruised, and
the caraway and coriander seeds, which
should be pounded. Having mixed all
thoroughly together, break in an egg,
and work the whole up with as much
fine flour as may be necessary to form a
paste. Make this into nuts of any size,
and put them on a tin plate, and bake
in a slow oven from ¼ to ½ hour. <i>Time.</i>—¼
to ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>GINGERBREAD-NUTS, Sunderland.
(An Excellent Recipe.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1¾ lb. of treacle, 1 lb. of
moist sugar, 1 lb. of butter, 2¾ lbs.
of flour, 1½ oz. of ground ginger, 1½ oz.
of allspice, 1½ oz. of coriander-seeds.
<i>Mode.</i>—Let the allspice, coriander-seeds,
and ginger be freshly ground; put them
into a basin, with the flour and sugar,
and mix these ingredients well together;
warm the treacle and butter together;
then with a spoon work it into the flour,
&amp;c. until the whole forms a nice smooth
paste. Drop the mixture from the spoon
on a piece of buttered paper, and bake
in rather a slow oven from 20 minutes
to ½ hour. A little candied lemon-peel
mixed with the above is an improvement,
and a great authority in culinary matters
suggests the addition of a little cayenne
pepper in gingerbread. Whether it be
advisable to use the latter ingredient or
not, we leave our readers to decide.
<i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to ½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>GLAZE for covering Cold Hams,
Tongues, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Stock, doubling the quantity
of meat in the recipes. <i>Mode.</i>—We
may remark at the outset, that unless
glaze is wanted in very large quantities,
it is seldom made expressly. Either of
the stocks, boiled down and reduced
very considerably, will be found to produce
a very good glaze. Put the stock
into a stewpan, over a nice clear fire;
let it boil till it becomes somewhat stiff,
when keep stirring, to prevent its burning.
The moment it is sufficiently reduced,
and come to a glaze, turn it into
the glaze-pot before it gets cold. As, however,
this is not to be found in every
establishment, a white earthenware jar
would answer the purpose; and this may
be placed in a vessel of boiling water, to
melt the glaze when required. It should
never be warmed in a saucepan, except
on the principle of the bain marie, lest
it should reduce too much, and become
black and bitter. If the glaze is wanted
of a pale colour, more veal than beef
should be used in making the stock;
and it is as well to omit turnips and
celery, as those impart a disagreeable
bitter flavour.</p>


<h3>GLAZE-KETTLE.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 202px;">
<img src="images/illus-139.jpg" width="202" height="175" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">GLAZE-KETTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>This is a kettle used for keeping the
strong stock boiled down to a jelly,
which is known by the name of glaze.
It is composed of two tin vessels, as
shown in the cut, one of which, the
upper,—containing the glaze, is inserted
into one of larger diameter, and containing
boiling water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>


<h3>GLAZE, to, Cold Joints, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Melt the glaze by placing the vessel
which contains it, into the bain marie or
saucepan of boiling water; brush it over
the meat with a paste-brush, and if in
places it is not quite covered, repeat the
operation. The glaze should not be too
dark a colour.</p>


<h3>GOLDEN PUDDING.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of bread-crumbs,
¼ lb. of suet, ¼ lb. of marmalade, ¼ lb. of
sugar, 4 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the bread-crumbs
into a basin; mix with them the
suet, which should be finely minced, the
marmalade, and the sugar; stir all these
ingredients well together, beat the eggs
to a froth, moisten the pudding with
these, and when well mixed put it into a
mould or buttered basin; tie down with
a floured cloth, and boil for 2 hours.
When turned out, strew a little fine-sifted
sugar over the top, and serve.
<i>Time.</i>—2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 11<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The mould may be ornamented
with stoned raisins, arranged in any fanciful
pattern, before the mixture is poured
in, which would add very much to the
appearance of the pudding. For a plainer
pudding, double the quantities of the
bread-crumbs; and if the eggs do not
moisten it sufficiently, use a little milk.</p>


<h3>GOOSE, Green.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Goose, 3 oz. of butter,
pepper and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Geese
are called green till they are about four
months old, and should not be stuffed.
After it has been singed and trussed, put
into the body a seasoning of pepper and
salt, and the butter to moisten it inside.
Roast before a clear fire for about ¾ hour,
froth and brown it nicely, and serve with
a brown gravy, and, when liked, gooseberry-sauce.
This dish should be garnished
with water-cresses. <i>Time.</i>—About
¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in
June, July, and August.</p>


<h3>GOOSE, Hashed.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast goose, 2
onions, 2 oz. of butter, 1 pint of boiling
water, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, pepper
and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of
port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom
ketchup. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the goose into
pieces of the size required; the inferior
joints, trimmings, &amp;c., put into a stewpan
to make the gravy; slice and fry the
onions in the butter of a very pale brown;
add these to the trimmings, and pour
over about a pint of boiling water; stew
these gently for ¾ hour, then skim and
strain the liquor. Thicken it with flour,
and flavour with port wine and ketchup
in the above proportion; add a seasoning
of pepper and salt, and put in the pieces
of goose; let these get thoroughly hot
through, but do not allow them to boil,
and serve with sippets of toasted bread.
<i>Time.</i>—Altogether, rather more than 1
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the cold
goose, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to March.</p>


<h3>GOOSE, Roast.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 276px;">
<img src="images/illus-140.jpg" width="276" height="119" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">ROAST GOOSE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Goose, 4 large onions,
10 sage-leaves, ¼ lb. of bread-crumbs,
1½ oz. of butter, salt and pepper to taste,
1 egg. <i>Choosing and Trussing.</i>—Select
a goose with a clean white skin, plump
breast, and yellow feet: if these latter
are red, the bird is old. Should the weather
permit, let it hang for a few days;
by so doing the flavour will be very much
improved. Pluck, singe, draw, and carefully
wash and wipe the goose; cut off
the neck close to the back, leaving the
skin long enough to turn over; cut off
the feet at the first joint, and separate
the pinions at the first joint. Beat the
breastbone flat with a rolling-pin, put a
skewer through the under part of each
wing, and having drawn up the legs
closely, put a skewer into the middle of
each, and pass the same quite through
the body. Insert another skewer into
the small of the leg, bring it close down
to the side-bone, run it through, and do
the same to the other side. Now cut off
the end of the vent, and make a hole in
the skin sufficiently large for the passage
of the rump, in order to keep in the seasoning.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make a sage-and-onion
stuffing of the above ingredients, put it
into the body of the goose, and secure it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
firmly at both ends by passing the rump
through the hole made in the skin, and
the other end by tying the skin of the
neck to the back: by this means the
seasoning will not escape. Put it down
to a brisk fire, keep it well basted, and
roast from 1½ to 2 hours, according
to the size. Remove the skewers, and
serve with a tureen of good gravy, and
one of well-made apple sauce. Should a
very highly-flavoured seasoning be preferred,
the onions should not be parboiled,
but minced raw: of the two methods the
mild seasoning is far superior. A ragoût,
or pie, should be made of the giblets, or
they may be stewed down to make gravy.
Be careful to serve the goose before the
breast falls, or its appearance will be
spoiled by coming flattened to table.
As this is rather a troublesome joint to
carve, a <i>large</i> quantity of gravy should
not be poured round the goose, but sent
in a tureen. <i>Time.</i>—A large goose, 1¾
hour; a moderate-sized one, 1/¼ to 1½
hour. <i>Seasonable</i> from September to
March; but in perfection from Michaelmas
to Christmas. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 or 9 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A teaspoonful of made mustard,
a saltspoonful of salt, a few grains of
cayenne, mixed with a glass of port wine,
are sometimes poured into the goose by
a slit made in the apron. This sauce is
by many considered an improvement.</p>


<h3>GOOSE, Roast, to Carve.</h3>

<div class="caption">LEG, WING, AND NECK-BONE
OF GOOSE.</div>
</div>
<p>It would not be fair to say that this
dish bodes a great deal of happiness to
an inexperienced carver, especially if
there is a large party to serve, and the
slices off the breast should not suffice to
satisfy the desires and cravings of many
wholesome appetites, produced, may be,
by the various sports in vogue at Michaelmas
and Christmas. The beginning of
the task, however, is not in any way difficult.
Evenly-cut slices, not too thick
or too thin, should be carved from the
breast in the direction of the line from
2 to 3; after the first slice has been cut,
a hole should be made with the knife in
the part called the apron, passing it
round the line as indicated by the figures
1, 1, 1; here the stuffing is located, and
some of this should be served on each
plate, unless it is discovered that it is
not agreeable to the taste of some one
guest. If the carver manages cleverly,
he will be able to cut a very large number
of fine slices off the breast, and the
more so if he commences close down by
the wing, and carves upwards towards
the ridge of the breastbone. As many
slices as can be taken from the breast
being carved, the wings should be cut
off, and the same
process as described
in carving
boiled fowl is made
use of in this instance,
only more
dexterity and
greater force will
most probably be
required. The
shape of the leg,
when disengaged
from the body of
the goose, should
be like that shown
in the accompanying
engraving. It
will be necessary,
perhaps, in taking
off the leg, to turn
the goose on its side, and then, pressing
down the small end of the leg, the knife
should be passed under it from the top
quite down to the joint; the leg being
now turned back by the fork, the knife
must cut through the joint, loosening the
thighbone from its socket. The merrythought,
which in a goose is not so large
as might be expected, is disengaged in
the same way as that of a fowl—by passing
the knife under it, and pressing it
backwards towards the neck. The neck-bones,
of which we give a cut, are freed
by the same process as are those of a
fowl; and the same may be said of all
the other parts of this bird. The breast
of a goose is the part most esteemed;
all parts, however, are good, and full of
juicy flavour.</p>




<h3>GOOSE STUFFING, Soyer’s Recipe
for.</h3>

<p>Take 4 apples peeled and cored, 4
onions, 4 leaves of sage, and 4 leaves of
lemon thyme not broken, and boil them
in a stewpan with sufficient water to cover
them; when done, pulp them through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
sieve, removing the sage and thyme;
then add sufficient pulp of mealy potatoes
to cause it to be sufficiently dry
without sticking to the hand; add pepper
and salt, and stuff the bird.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRIES, Compôte of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Syrup; to 1 pint of syrup
allow nearly a quart of gooseberries.
<i>Mode.</i>—Top and tail the gooseberries,
which should not be very ripe, and pour
over them some boiling water; then take
them out and plunge them into cold
water with which has been mixed a tablespoonful
of vinegar, which will assist to
keep the fruit a good colour. Make a
pint of syrup, and when it boils drain
the gooseberries and put them in; simmer
them gently until the fruit is nicely
pulped and tender without being broken;
then dish the gooseberries on a glass
dish, boil the syrup for 2 or 3 minutes,
pour over the gooseberries, and serve
cold. <i>Time.</i>—About 5 minutes to boil
the gooseberries in the syrup, 3 minutes
to reduce the syrup. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient.</i>—A quart of gooseberries for 5
or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in June.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY CHIPS. (Useful
for Dessert.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Gooseberries unripe and
green, but quite full-grown; sifted loaf
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the gooseberries,
when cleaned of tops and tails, into jars,
and boil them in a copper till quite soft.
To every lb. of pulp put ½ lb. of loaf sugar
sifted: the sugar must be stirred in very
gently. Then pour out the sweetened
pulp on flat dishes, about ⅛ inch thick,
which must be set in the sun to dry.
When sufficiently dried in the sun, the
pulp may be cut into strips, and twisted
into any fanciful shapes, bows, &amp;c. <i>Time</i>
for drying, according to the amount of
sun. <i>Seasonable</i> at all times.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—These chips may be kept for
years in tin boxes, if packed quite dry,
with layers of paper between the rows.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY FOOL.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Green gooseberries; to
every pint of pulp add 1 pint of milk, or
½ pint of cream and ½ pint of milk; sugar
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the tops and tails
off the gooseberries, put them into a jar
with 2 tablespoonfuls of water and a little
good moist sugar; set this jar in a saucepan
of boiling water, and let it boil until
the fruit is soft enough to mash. When
done enough, beat it to a pulp, work this
pulp through a colander, and stir to every
pint the above proportion of milk, or
equal quantities of milk and cream. Ascertain
if the mixture is sweet enough,
and put in plenty of sugar, or it will not
be eatable; and in mixing the milk and
gooseberries add the former very gradually
to these: serve in a glass dish, or in
small glasses. This, although a very old-fashioned
and homely dish, is, when well
made, very delicious, and, if properly
sweetened, a very suitable preparation
for children. <i>Time.</i>—From ¾ to 1 hour.
<i>Average cost,</i> 6<i>d.</i> per pint, with milk.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—A pint of milk and a pint of
gooseberry pulp for 5 or 6 children.
<i>Seasonable</i> in May and June.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit allow
¾ lb. of loaf sugar; currant-juice.
<i>Mode.</i>—Select red hairy gooseberries;
have them gathered in dry weather,
when quite ripe, without being too soft.
Weigh them; with a pair of scissors cut
off the tops and tails, and to every 6 lbs.
of fruit have ready ½ pint of red-currant
juice, drawn as for jelly. Put the gooseberries
and currant-juice into a preserving-pan,
let them boil tolerably
quickly, keeping them well stirred; when
they begin to break, add to them the
sugar, and keep simmering until the jam
becomes firm, carefully skimming and
stirring it, that it does not burn at the
bottom. It should be boiled rather a
long time, or it will not keep. Put it
into pots (not too large), let it get perfectly
cold, then cover the pots down
with oiled and egged papers. <i>Time.</i>—About
1 hour to boil the gooseberries in
the currant-juice, from ½ to ¾ hour with
the sugar. <i>Average cost</i>, per lb. pot, from
6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1½ pint of
fruit for a lb. pot. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in June or July.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every 8 lbs. of red,
rough, ripe gooseberries allow 1 quart of
red-currant juice, 5 lbs. of loaf sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Have the fruit gathered in dry
weather, and cut off the tops and tails.
Prepare 1 quart of red-currant juice, the
same as for red-currant jelly; put it into
a preserving-pan with the sugar, and
keep stirring until the latter is dissolved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Keep it boiling for about 5 minutes;
skim well; then put in the gooseberries,
and let them boil from ½ to ¾ hour; then
turn the whole into an earthen pan, and
let it remain for 2 days. Boil the jam
up again until it looks clear; put it into
pots, and when cold, cover with oiled
paper, and over the jars put tissue-paper
brushed over on both sides with the
white of an egg, and store away in a dry
place. Care must be taken, in making
this, to keep the jam well stirred and
well skimmed, to prevent it burning at
the bottom of the pan, and to have it
very clear. <i>Time.</i>—5 minutes to boil
the currant-juice and sugar after the
latter is dissolved; from ½ to ¾ hour to
simmer the gooseberries the first time,
¼ hour the second time of boiling. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 8<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i> per lb. pot.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1½ pint of fruit for a
lb. pot. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in June
or July.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY JAM, White or
Green.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Equal weight of fruit and
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Select the gooseberries
not very ripe, either white or green, and
top and tail them. Boil the sugar with
water (allowing ½ pint to every lb.) for
about ¼ hour, carefully removing the
scum as it rises; then put in the gooseberries,
and simmer gently till clear and
firm: try a little of the jam on a plate; if
it jellies when cold, it is done, and should
then be poured into pots. When cold,
cover with oiled paper, and tissue-paper
brushed over on both sides with the unbeaten
white of an egg, and stow away
in a dry place. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour to boil
the sugar and water, ¾ hour the jam.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per lb. pot.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1½ pint of fruit for a lb.
pot. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in June.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Gooseberries; to every
pint of juice allow ¾ lb. of loaf sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the gooseberries, after cutting
off the tops and tails, into a preserving-pan,
and stir them over the fire
until they are quite soft; then strain
them through a sieve, and to every pint
of juice allow ¾ lb. of sugar. Boil the
juice and sugar together for nearly ¾
hour, stirring and skimming all the time;
and if the jelly appears firm when a little
of it is poured on to a plate, it is done,
and should then be taken up and put
into small pots. Cover the pots with
oiled and egged papers, the same as for
currant jelly, and store away in a dry
place. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour to simmer the
gooseberries without the sugar; ¾ hour to
boil the juice. <i>Average cost</i>, from 8<i>d.</i> to
10<i>d.</i> per ½-lb. pot. <i>Seasonable</i> in July.</p>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Gooseberries, 3 eggs,
1½ oz. of butter, ½ pint of bread-crumbs,
sugar to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the gooseberries
into a jar, previously cutting off
the tops and tails; place this jar in boiling
water, and let it boil until the gooseberries
are soft enough to pulp; then
beat them through a coarse sieve, and to
every pint of pulp add 3 well-whisked
eggs, 1½ oz. of butter, ½ pint of bread-crumbs,
and sugar to taste; beat the
mixture well, put a border of puff-paste
round the edge of a pie-dish, put in the

<div class="caption">BOILED FRUIT PUDDING</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ lb. of suet crust, 1½
pint of green gooseberries, ¼ lb. of moist
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Line a pudding-basin
with suet crust rolled out to about ½ inch
in thickness, and, with a pair of scissors,
cut off the tops and tails of the gooseberries;
fill the basin with the fruit, put
in the sugar,
and cover
with crust.
Pinch the

<h3>GOOSEBERRY SAUCE for
Boiled Mackerel.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of green gooseberries,
3 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
(veal gravy may be substituted for this),
2 oz. of fresh butter; seasoning to taste
of salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil the gooseberries in water
until quite tender; strain them, and rub
them through a sieve. Put into a saucepan
the Béchamel or gravy, with the
butter and seasoning; add the pulp from
the gooseberries, mix all well together,
and heat gradually through. A little
pounded sugar added to this sauce is by
many persons considered an improvement,
as the saccharine matter takes off
the extreme acidity of the unripe fruit.
<i>Time.</i>—Boil the gooseberries from 20
minutes to ½ hour. <i>Sufficient.</i>—This
quantity, for a large dish of mackerel.
<i>Seasonable</i> from May to July.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY TART.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of gooseberries,
½ lb. of short crust, ¼ lb. of moist sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—With a pair of scissors cut off
the tops and tails of the gooseberries;
put them into a deep pie-dish, pile the
fruit high in the centre, and put in the
sugar; line the edge of the dish with
short crust, put on the cover, and ornament
the edges of the tart; bake in a
good oven for about ¾ hour, and before
being sent to table, strew over it some
fine-sifted sugar. A jug of cream, or a
dish of boiled or baked custards, should
always accompany this dish. <i>Time.</i>—¾
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from May to
July.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY TRIFLE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 quart of gooseberries,
sugar to taste, 1 pint of custard, a plateful
of whipped cream. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the
gooseberries into a jar, with sufficient
moist sugar to sweeten them, and boil
them until reduced to a pulp. Put this
pulp at the bottom of a trifle-dish; pour
over it a pint of custard made by recipe,
and, when cold, cover with whipped
cream. The cream should be whipped
the day before it is wanted for table, as
it will then be so much firmer and more
solid; but it should not be added to the
fruit until a short time before it is required.
The dish may be garnished as
fancy dictates. <i>Time.</i>—About ¾ hour to
boil the gooseberries. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 trifle. <i>Seasonable</i>
in May, June, and July.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY VINEGAR. (An
Excellent Recipe.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 pecks of crystal gooseberries,
6 gallons of water, 12 lbs. of
foots sugar of the coarsest brown quality.
<i>Mode.</i>—Mash the gooseberries (which
should be quite ripe) in a tub with a
mallet; put to them the water nearly
milk-warm; let this stand 24 hours; then
strain it through a sieve, and put the
sugar to it; mix it well, and tun it.
These proportions are for a 9-gallon cask;
and if it be not quite full, more water must
be added. Let the mixture be stirred
from the bottom of the cask two or three
times daily for three or four days, to
assist the melting of the sugar; then
paste a piece of linen cloth over the
bunghole, and set the cask in a warm
place, <i>but not in the sun</i>; any corner of
a warm kitchen is the best situation for
it. The following spring it should be
drawn off into stone bottles, and the
vinegar will be fit for use twelve months
after it is made. This will be found a
most excellent preparation, greatly superior
to much that is sold under the
name of the best white wine vinegar.
Many years’ experience has proved that
pickle made with this vinegar will keep,
when bought vinegar will not preserve
the ingredients. The cost per gallon is
merely nominal, especially to those who
reside in the country and grow their
own gooseberries; the coarse sugar is
then the only ingredient to be purchased.
<i>Time.</i>—To remain in the cask 9 months.
<i>Average cost</i>, when the gooseberries have
to be purchased, 1<i>s.</i> per gallon; when
they are grown at home, 6<i>d.</i> per gallon.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—This should be made the
end of June or the beginning of July,
when gooseberries are ripe and plentiful.</p>


<h3>GOOSEBERRY WINE, Effervescing.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every gallon of water
allow 6 lbs. of green gooseberries, 3 lbs.
of lump sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—This wine should
be prepared from unripe gooseberries, in
order to avoid the flavour which the fruit
would give to the wine when in a mature
state. Its briskness depends more upon
the time of bottling than upon the unripe
state of the fruit, for effervescing
wine can be made from fruit that is ripe
as well as that which is unripe. The fruit
should be selected when it has nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
attained its full growth, and consequently
before it shows any tendency to ripen.
Any bruised or decayed berries, and those
that are very small, should be rejected.
The blossom and stalk ends should be
removed, and the fruit well bruised in a
tub or pan, in such quantities as to
insure each berry being broken without
crushing the seeds. Pour the water
(which should be warm) on the fruit,
squeeze and stir it with the hand until
all the pulp is removed from the skin and
seeds, and cover the whole closely for
24 hours; after which, strain it through
a coarse bag, and press it with as much
force as can be conveniently applied, to
extract the whole of the juice and liquor
the fruit may contain. To every 40 or
50 lbs. of fruit one gallon more of hot
water may be passed through the <i>marc</i>,
or husks, in order to obtain any soluble
matter that may remain, and be again
pressed. The juice should be put into a
tub or pan of sufficient size to contain all
of it, and the sugar added to it. Let it
be well stirred until the sugar is dissolved,
and place the pan in a warm situation;
keep it closely covered, and let it ferment
for a day or two. It must then be drawn
off into clean casks, placed a little on one
side for the scum that arises to be thrown
out, and the casks kept filled with the
remaining “must,” that should be reserved
for that purpose. When the active
fermentation has ceased, the casks should
be plugged upright, again filled, if necessary,
the bungs be put in loosely, and,
after a few days, when the fermentation
is a little more languid (which may be
known by the hissing noise ceasing), the
bungs should be driven in tight, and a
spile-hole made, to give vent if necessary.
About November or December, on a clear
fine day, the wine should be racked from
its lees into clean casks, which may be
rinsed with brandy. After a month, it
should be examined to see if it is sufficiently
clear for bottling; if not, it must
be fined with isinglass, which may be
dissolved in some of the wine: 1 oz. will
be sufficient for 9 gallons. In bottling
the wine, it will be necessary to wire the
corks down, or to tie them down with
string. Old champagne bottles are the
best for this wine. In March or April, or
when the gooseberry bushes begin to
blossom, the wine must be bottled, in
order to insure its being effervescing. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this the end of May or beginning
of June, before the berries ripen.</p>


<h3>GRAVIES, General Stock for</h3>

<p>By the addition of various store sauces,
thickening and flavouring, good stock
may be converted into good gravies. It
should be borne in mind, however, that
the goodness and strength of spices,
wines, flavourings, &amp;c., evaporate, and
that they lose a great deal of their fragrance
if added to the gravy a long time
before they are wanted. If this point
is attended to, a saving of one half the
quantity of these ingredients will be
effected, as, with long boiling, the flavour
almost entirely passes away. The
shank-bones of mutton, previously well
soaked, will be found a great assistance
in enriching gravies; a kidney or melt,
beef skirt, trimmings of meat, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
answer very well when only a small quantity
is wanted, and a good gravy need
not necessarily be so very expensive; for
economically-prepared dishes are oftentimes
found as savoury and wholesome as
dearer ones. The cook should also remember
that the fragrance of gravies
should not be overpowered by too much
spice, or any strong essences, and that
they should always be warmed in a <i>bain
marie</i>, after they are flavoured, or else in
a jar or jug placed in a saucepan full of
boiling water. The remains of roast-meat
gravy should always be saved; as,
when no meat is at hand, a very nice
gravy in haste may be made from it, and
when added to hashes, ragoûts, &amp;c., is a
great improvement.</p>

above quantity of water; tie down the
jar, or put a plate over the top, so that
the steam may not escape; place it in
the oven, and let it remain there from 6
to 8 hours; should, however, the oven
be very hot, less time will be required.
When sufficiently cooked, strain the
gravy, and when cold, remove the fat.
It may be flavoured with ketchup, wines,
or any other store sauce that may be preferred.
It is a good plan to put the jar
in a cool oven over-night, to draw the
gravy; and then it will not require so
long baking the following day. <i>Time.</i>—From
6 to 8 hours, according to the oven.
<i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> per pint.</p>


<h3>GRAVY-KETTLE.</h3>

<p>This is a utensil which will not be
found in every kitchen; but it is a useful
one where it is necessary to keep gravies
hot for the purpose of pouring over various
dishes as they are cooking. It is
made of copper, and should, consequently,
be heated over the hot-plate, if
there be one, or a charcoal stove.</p>

when no more appears, add all the other
ingredients, and let the soup simmer
slowly by the fire for 6 hours without
stirring it any more from the bottom;
take it off, and let it settle; skim off all
the fat you can, and pass it through a
sieve or cloth. When perfectly cold you
can remove all the fat, and leave the
sediment untouched, which serves very
nicely for thick gravies, hashes, &amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—7
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per quart.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 14
persons.</p>


<h3>GRAVY, Veal, for White Sauces,
Fricassees, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 slices of nicely-flavoured
lean ham, any poultry trimmings,
3 lbs. of lean veal, a faggot of savoury
herbs, including parsley, a few green
onions (or 1 large onion may be substituted
for these), a few mushrooms, when
obtainable; 1 blade of mace, salt to
taste, 3 pints of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut up
the ham and veal into small square
pieces, put these in a stewpan, moistening
them with a small quantity of water;
place them over the fire to draw down.
When the bottom of the stewpan becomes
covered with a white glaze, fill up with
water in the above proportion; add the
remaining ingredients, stew very slowly
for 3 or 4 hours, and do not forget to
skim well the moment it boils. Put it
by, and when cold take off all the fat.
This may be used for Béchamel, sauce
tournée, and many other white sauces.
<i>Time.</i>—3 or 4 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i>
per pint.</p>


<h3>GREENGAGE JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit,
weighed before being stoned, allow ¾ lb.
of lump sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Divide the greengages,
take out the stones, and put them
into a preserving-pan. Bring the fruit
to a boil, then add the sugar, and keep
stirring it over a gentle fire until it is
melted. Remove all the scum as it rises,
and, just before the jam is done, boil it
rapidly for 5 minutes. To ascertain when
it is sufficiently boiled, pour a little on a
plate, and if the syrup thickens and appears
firm, it is done. Have ready half
the kernels blanched; put them into the
jam, give them one boil, and pour the
preserve into pots. When cold, cover
down with oiled papers, and, over these,
tissue paper brushed over on both sides
with the white of an egg. <i>Time.</i>—¾
hour after the sugar is added. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per lb. pot. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
about 1½ pint of fruit for
every lb. pot of jam. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in August or September.</p>


<h3>GREENGAGES, Compôte of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of syrup, 1 quart
of greengages. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a syrup,
skim it well, and put in the greengages
when the syrup is boiling, having previously
removed the stalks and stones from
the fruit. Boil gently for ¼ hour, or until
the fruit is tender; but take care not to
let it break, as the appearance of the
dish would be spoiled were the fruit reduced
to a pulp. Take the greengages
carefully out, place them on a glass dish,
boil the syrup for another 5 minutes, let
it cool a little, pour over the fruit, and,
when cold, it will be ready for use. <i>Time.</i>—¼
hour to simmer the fruit, 5 minutes
the syrup. <i>Average cost</i>, in full season,
10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in July, August, and September.</p>


<h3>GREENGAGES, to Preserve and
Dry.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of sugar
allow 1 lb. of fruit, ¼ pint of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—For this purpose, the fruit must
be used before it is quite ripe, and part
of the stalk must be left on. Weigh the
fruit, rejecting all that is in the least degree
blemished, and put it into a lined
saucepan with the sugar and water,
which should have been previously boiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
together to a rich syrup. Boil the fruit
in this for 10 minutes, remove it from
the fire, and drain the greengages. The
next day, boil up the syrup and put in
the fruit again, and let it simmer for 3
minutes, and drain the syrup away.
Continue this process for 5 or 6 days,
and the last time place the greengages,
when drained, on a hair sieve, and put
them in an oven or warm spot to dry;
keep them in a box, with paper between
each layer, in a place free from damp.
<i>Time.</i>—10 minutes the first time of boiling.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in August
or September.</p>


<h3>GREENGAGES, Preserved in
Syrup.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit allow
1 lb. of loaf sugar, ¼ pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the sugar and water together for
about 10 minutes; divide the greengages,
take out the stones, put the fruit
into the syrup, and let it simmer gently
until nearly tender. Take it off the fire,
put it into a large pan, and, the next day,
boil it up again for about 10 minutes
with the kernels from the stones, which
should be blanched. Put the fruit carefully
into jars, pour over it the syrup,
and, when cold, cover down, so that the
air is quite excluded. Let the syrup be
well skimmed both the first and second
day of boiling, otherwise it will not be
clear. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes to boil the
syrup; ¼ hour to simmer the fruit the
first day, 10 minutes the second day.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per lb. pot.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow about 1 pint of fruit
to fill a 1-lb. pot. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in August or September.</p>


<h3>GREENS, Boiled Turnip.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each ½ gallon of water
allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; turnip-greens.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the greens
well in two or three waters, and pick off
all the decayed and dead leaves; tie
them in small bunches, and put them
into plenty of boiling water, salted in the
above proportion. Keep them boiling
quickly, with the lid of the saucepan
uncovered, and when tender, pour them
into a colander; let them drain, arrange
them in a vegetable-dish, remove the
string that the greens were tied with,
and serve. <i>Time.</i>—15 to 20 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> for a dish for 3 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in March, April, and May.</p>


<h3>GROUSE PIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Grouse; cayenne, salt,
and pepper to taste; 1 lb. of rump-steak,
½ pint of well-seasoned broth, puff-paste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Line the bottom of a pie-dish
with the rump-steak cut into neat pieces,
and, should the grouse be large, cut them
into joints; but, if small, they may be
laid in the pie whole; season highly with
salt, cayenne, and black pepper; pour
in the broth, and cover with a puff-paste;
brush the crust over with the yolk of an
egg, and bake from ¾ to 1 hour. If the
grouse is cut into joints, the backbones
and trimmings will make the gravy, by
stewing them with an onion, a little
sherry, a bunch of herbs, and a blade of
mace: this should be poured in after
the pie is baked. <i>Time.</i>—¾ to 1 hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the grouse,
which are seldom bought, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
from the 12th of August to the
beginning of December.</p>

<h3>GROUSE, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Grouse, butter, a thick
slice of toasted bread. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the
birds hang as long as possible; pluck and
draw them; wipe, but do not wash them,
inside and out, and truss them without
the head, the same as for a roast fowl.
Many persons still continue to truss them
with the head under the wing, but the
former is now considered the most approved
method. Put them down to a
sharp clear fire; keep them well basted
the whole of the time they are cooking,
and serve them on a buttered toast,
soaked in the dripping-pan, with a little
melted butter poured over them, or with
bread-sauce and gravy. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour; if liked very thoroughly done, 35
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
the brace; but seldom bought. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2
for a dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from
the 12th of August to the beginning of
December.</p>




<h3>GROUSE, to Carve.</h3>

<p>Grouse may be carved in the way first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
described in carving partridge. The
backbone of the
grouse is highly
esteemed by many,
and this part of
many game birds
is considered the finest-flavoured.</p>

<h3>GROUSE SALAD (Soyer’s Recipe
improved.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 eggs, butter, fresh salad,
2 or 3 grouse; for the sauce, 1 tablespoonful
of minced shalot, 2 tablespoonfuls
of pounded sugar, the yolks of 2
eggs, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley,
¼ oz. of salt, 12 tablespoonfuls of oil,
4 tablespoonfuls of Chili vinegar, 1 gill
of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of chopped
tarragon and chervil. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the
eggs hard, shell them, throw them into
cold water, cut a thin slice off the bottom
to facilitate the proper placing of
them in the dish, cut each one into four
lengthwise, and make a very thin flat
border of butter, about one inch from the
edge of the dish the salad is to be served
on; fix the pieces of egg upright close
to each other, the yolk outside, or the
yolk and white alternately; lay in the
centre a fresh salad of whatever is in season,
and, having previously roasted the
grouse rather underdone, cut it into eight
or ten pieces, and prepare the sauce as
follows:—Put the shalots into a basin,
with the sugar, the yolk of an egg, the
parsley, and salt, and mix in by degrees
the oil and vinegar; when all the ingredients
are well mixed, put the sauce on
ice or in a cool place. When ready to
serve, whip the cream rather thick, which
lightly mix with it; then lay the inferior
parts of the grouse on the salad, sauce
over so as to cover each piece, then lay
over the salad and the remainder of the
grouse, pour the rest of the sauce over,
and serve. The eggs may be ornamented
with a little dot of radishes or beetroot
on the point. Anchovy and gherkin, cut
into small diamonds, may be placed between,
or cut gherkins in slices, and a
border of them laid round. Tarragon or
chervil-leaves are also a pretty addition.
The remains of cold black-game, pheasant,
or partridge may be used in the
above manner, and will make a very delicate
dish. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
from the 12th of August to the
beginning of December.</p>


<h3>GRUEL, to make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 tablespoonful of Robinson’s
patent groats, 2 tablespoonfuls of
cold water, 1 pint of boiling water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Mix the prepared groats smoothly
with the cold water in a basin; pour
over them the boiling water, stirring it
all the time. Put it into a very clean
saucepan; boil the gruel for 10 minutes,
keeping it well stirred; sweeten to taste,
and serve. It may be flavoured with a
small piece of lemon-peel, by boiling it
in the gruel, or a little grated nutmeg
may be put in; but in these matters the
taste of the patient should be consulted.
Pour the gruel in a tumbler, and serve.
When wine is allowed to the invalid, 2
tablespoonfuls of sherry or port make
this preparation very nice. In cases of
colds, the same quantity of spirits is
sometimes added instead of wine. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes. <i>Sufficient</i> to make a pint
of gruel.</p>


<h3>GUDGEONS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Egg and bread-crumbs
sufficient for the quantity of fish; hot
lard. <i>Mode.</i>—Do not scrape off the
scales, but take out the gills and inside,
and cleanse thoroughly; wipe them dry,
flour and dip them into egg, and sprinkle
over with bread-crumbs. Fry of a nice
brown. <i>Time.</i>—3 or 4 minutes. <i>Average
cost.</i>—Seldom bought. <i>Seasonable</i>
from March to July. <i>Sufficient.</i>—3 for
each person.</p>


<h3>GUINEA-FOWL, Roast, Larded.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A guinea-fowl, lardoons,
flour, and salt. <i>Mode.</i>—When this bird
is larded, it should be trussed the same
as a pheasant; if plainly roasted, truss
it like a turkey. After larding and trussing
it, put it down to roast at a brisk
fire; keep it well basted, and a short
time before serving, dredge it with a
little flour, and let it froth nicely. Serve
with a little gravy in the dish, and a
tureen of the same, and one of well-made
bread-sauce. <i>Time.</i>—Guinea-fowl, larded,
1¼ hour; plainly roasted, about 1
hour. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
in winter.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The breast, if larded, should
be covered with a piece of paper, and removed
about 10 minutes before serving.</p>


<h3>GURNET, or GURNARD.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 gurnet, 6 oz. of salt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
each gallon of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse
the fish thoroughly, and cut off the fins;
have ready some boiling water, with salt
in the above proportion; put the fish in,
and simmer very gently for ½ hour.
Parsley and butter, or anchovy sauce,
should be served with it. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour.
<i>Average cost.</i>—Seldom bought. <i>Seasonable</i>
from October to March, but in perfection
in October. <i>Sufficient.</i>—A middling-sized
one for two persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This fish is frequently stuffed
with forcemeat, and baked.</p>


<h3>HADDOCK, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A nice forcemeat, butter
to taste, egg and bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Scale
and clean the fish, without cutting
it open much; put in a nice delicate
forcemeat, and sew up the slit. Brush it
over with egg, sprinkle over bread-crumbs,
and baste frequently with butter.
Garnish with parsley and cut
lemon, and serve with, a nice brown
gravy, plain melted butter, or anchovy
sauce. The egg and bread-crumbs can
be omitted, and pieces of butter placed
over the fish. <i>Time.</i>—Large haddock, ¾
hour; moderate size, ¼ hour. <i>Seasonable</i>
from August to February. <i>Average cost</i>,
from 9<i>d.</i> upwards.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Haddocks may be filleted, rubbed
over with egg and bread-crumbs,
and fried a nice brown; garnish with
crisped parsley.</p>


<h3>HADDOCK, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sufficient water to cover
the fish; ¼ lb. of salt to each gallon of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Scrape the fish, take out
the inside, wash it thoroughly, and lay it
in a kettle, with enough water to cover it,
and salt in the above proportion. Simmer
gently from 15 to 20 minutes, or rather
more, should the fish be very large. For
small haddocks, fasten the tails in their
mouths, and put them into boiling water.
10 to 15 minutes will cook them. Serve
with plain melted butter, or anchovy sauce.
<i>Time.</i>—Large haddock, ½ hour; small, ¼
hour, or rather less. <i>Average cost</i>, from
9<i>d.</i> upwards. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to
February.</p>


<h3>HADDOCK, Dried.</h3>

<p>Dried haddock should be gradually
warmed through, either before or over a
nice clear fire. Rub a little piece of butter
over, just before sending it to table.</p>


<h3>HADDOCK, Dried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 large thick haddock, 2
bay-leaves, 1 small bunch of savoury
herbs, not forgetting parsley, a little
butter and pepper; boiling water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
up the haddock into square pieces,
make a basin hot by means of hot water,
which pour out. Lay in the fish, with
the bay-leaves and herbs; cover with
boiling water; put a plate over to keep
in the steam, and let it remain for 10
minutes. Take out the slices, put them
in a hot dish, rub over with butter and
pepper, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time, but best in
winter.</p>


<h3>HAM OMELET (a delicious Breakfast
Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 eggs, 4 oz. of butter, ½
saltspoonful of pepper, 2 tablespoonfuls
of minced ham. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince the ham
very finely, without any fat, and fry it
for 2 minutes in a little butter; then
make the batter for the omelet, stir in
the ham, and proceed as in the case of a
plain omelet. Do not add any salt to
the batter, as the ham is usually sufficiently
salt to impart a flavour to the
omelet. Good lean bacon, or tongue,
answers equally well for this dish; but
they must also be slightly cooked previously
to mixing them with the batter.
Serve very hot and quickly, without
gravy. <i>Time.</i>—From 4 to 6 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>HAM, FRIED, AND EGGS (a
Breakfast Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Ham; eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the ham into slices, and take care
that they are of the same thickness in
every part. Cut off the rind, and if the
ham should be particularly hard and
salt, it will be found an improvement to
soak it for about 10 minutes in hot water,
and then dry it in a cloth. Put it into a
cold frying-pan, set it over the fire, and
turn the slices 3 or 4 times whilst they
are cooking. When done, place them on
a dish, which should be kept hot in front
of the fire during the time the eggs are
being poached. Poach the eggs, slip
them on to the slices of ham, and serve
quickly. <i>Time.</i>—7 or 8 minutes to broil
the ham. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per lb.
by the whole ham. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 2<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
eggs and a slice of ham to each person.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Ham may also be toasted or
broiled; but, with the latter method, to
insure its being well cooked, the fire
must be beautifully clear, or it will have
a smoky flavour far from agreeable.</p>


<h3>HAM, Potted, that will keep Good
for some time.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To 4 lbs. of lean ham
allow 1 lb. of fat, 2 teaspoonfuls of
pounded mace, ½ nutmeg grated, rather
more than ½ teaspoonful of cayenne,
clarified lard. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince the ham,
fat and lean together in the above proportion,
and pound it well in a mortar,
seasoning it with cayenne pepper,
pounded mace, and nutmeg; put the
mixture into a deep baking-dish, and
bake for ½ hour; then press it well
into a stone jar, till up the jar with clarified
lard, cover it closely, and paste over
it a piece of thick paper. If well seasoned,
it will keep a long time in winter,
and will be found very convenient for
sandwiches, &amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>HAM, Potted (a nice addition to
the Breakfast or Luncheon table).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To 2 lbs. of lean ham
allow ½ lb. of fat, 1 teaspoonful of
pounded mace, ½ teaspoonful of pounded
allspice, ½ nutmeg, pepper to taste, clarified
butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut some slices
from the remains of a cold ham, mince
them small, and to every 2 lbs. of lean
allow the above proportion of fat. Pound
the ham in a mortar to a fine paste, with
the fat, gradually add the seasonings
and spices, and be very particular that
all the ingredients are well mixed and
the spices well pounded. Press the mixture
into potting-pots, pour over clarified
butter, and keep it in a cool place.
<i>Average cost</i> for this quantity, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>HAM, to Bake.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Ham; a common crust.
<i>Mode.</i>—As a ham for baking should be
well soaked, let it remain in water for
at least 12 hours. Wipe it dry, trim
away any rusty places underneath, and
cover it with a common crust, taking
care that this is of sufficient thickness all
over to keep the gravy in. Place it in a
moderately-heated oven, and bake for
nearly 4 hours. Take off the crust and
skin, and cover with raspings, the same as
for boiled ham, and garnish the knuckle
with a paper frill. This method of
cooking a ham is, by many persons, considered
far superior to boiling it, as it
cuts fuller of gravy and has a finer
flavour, besides keeping a much longer
time good. <i>Time.</i>—A medium-sized
ham, 4 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, from 8<i>d.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> per lb. by the whole ham. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year.</p>


<h3>HAM, to Boil.</h3>

<img src="images/illus-152.jpg" width="281" height="120" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">BOILED HAM.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Ham, water, glaze, or
raspings. <i>Mode.</i>—In choosing a ham,
ascertain that it is perfectly sweet, by
running a sharp knife into it, close to
the bone; and if, when the knife is withdrawn,
it has an agreeable smell, the
ham is good; if, on the contrary, the
blade has a greasy appearance and offensive
smell, the ham is bad. If it has been
long hung, and is very dry and salt, let
it remain in soak for 24 hours, changing
the water frequently. This length of time
is only necessary in the case of its being
very hard; from 8 to 12 hours would be
sufficient for a Yorkshire or Westmoreland
ham. Wash it thoroughly clean,
and trim away from the under-side all
the rusty and smoked parts, which would
spoil the appearance. Put it into a boiling-pot,
with sufficient cold water to cover
it; bring it gradually to boil, and as the
scum rises, carefully remove it. Keep it
simmering very gently until tender, and
be careful that it does not stop boiling,
nor boil too quickly. When done, take
it out of the pot, strip off the skin, and
sprinkle over it a few fine bread-raspings,
put a frill of cut paper round the knuckle,
and serve. If to be eaten cold, let the
ham remain in the water until nearly
cold: by this method the juices are kept
in, and it will be found infinitely superior
to one taken out of the water hot; it
should, however, be borne in mind that
the ham must <i>not</i> remain in the saucepan
<i>all</i> night. When the skin is removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
sprinkle over bread-raspings, or, if wanted
particularly nice, glaze it. Place a paper
frill round the knuckle, and garnish with
parsley or cut vegetable flowers. <i>Time.</i>—A
ham weighing 10 lbs., 4 hours to <i>simmer
gently</i>; 15 lbs., 5 hours; a very large
one, about 6 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, from
8<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per lb. by the whole ham.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>


<h3>HAM, how to Boil to give it an
excellent flavour.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Vinegar and water, 2
heads of celery, 2 turnips, 3 onions, a
large bunch of savoury herbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Prepare
the ham as in the preceding
recipe, and let it soak for a few hours in
vinegar and water. Put it on in cold
water, and when it boils, add the vegetables
and herbs. Simmer very gently
until tender, take it out, strip off the
skin, cover with bread-raspings, and put
a paper ruche or frill round the knuckle.
<i>Time.</i>—A ham weighing 10 lbs., 4 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per lb. by the
whole ham. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>HAM, to Carve.</h3>

<p>In cutting a ham, the carver must be
guided according as he desires to practise
economy, or have, at once, fine slices
out of the prime part. Under the first
supposition, he will commence at the
knuckle end, and cut off thin slices
towards the thick part of the ham. To
reach the choicer portion, the knife, which
must be very sharp and thin, should be
carried quite down to the bone, in the
direction of the line 1 to 2. The slices
should be thin and even, and always cut
down to the bone. There are some who
like to carve a ham by cutting a hole at
the top, and then slicing pieces off inside
the hole, gradually enlarging the circle;
but we think this is a plan not to be
recommended. A ham, when hot, is
usually sent to table with a paper ruffle
round the knuckle.</p>

Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—For 2 hams weighing
about 16 or 18 lbs. each, allow 1 lb. of
moist sugar, 1 lb. of common salt, 2 oz.
of saltpetre, 1 quart of good vinegar.
<i>Mode.</i>—As soon as the pig is cold enough
to be cut up, take the 2 hams and rub
them well with common salt, and leave
them in a large pan for 3 days. When
the salt has drawn out all the blood, drain
the hams, and throw the brine away.
Mix sugar, salt, and saltpetre together in
the above proportion, rub the hams well
with these, and put them into a vessel
large enough to hold them, always keeping
the salt over them. Let them remain
for 3 days, then pour over them a quart
of good vinegar. Turn them in the brine
every day for a month, then drain them
well, and rub them with bran. Have
them smoked over a wood fire, and be
particular that the hams are hung as high
up as possible from the fire; otherwise
the fat will melt, and they will become
dry and hard. <i>Time.</i>—To be pickled 1
month; to be smoked 1 month. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 2 hams of 18 lbs. each. <i>Seasonable</i>
from October to March.</p>


<h3>HAMS, to Cure Sweet, in the Westmoreland
way.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 lbs. of common salt, 3
lbs. of coarse sugar, 1 lb. of bay-salt, 3
quarts of strong beer. <i>Mode.</i>—Before
the hams are put into pickle, rub them
the preceding day well with salt, and
drain the brine well from them. Put the
above ingredients into a saucepan, and
boil for ¼ hour; pour over the hams, and
let them remain a month in the pickle.
Rub and turn them every day, but do not
take them out of the pickling-pan; and
have them smoked for a month. <i>Time.</i>—To
be pickled 1 month; to be smoked 1
month. <i>Seasonable</i> from October to
March.</p>


<h3>HAMS, to Pickle (Suffolk Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To a ham from 10 to 12
lbs., allow 1 lb. of coarse sugar, ¾ lb. of
salt, 1 oz. of saltpetre, ½ a teacupful of
vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub the hams well
with common salt, and leave them for a
day or two to drain; then rub well in
the above proportion of sugar, salt, saltpetre,
and vinegar, and turn them every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
other day. Keep them in the pickle 1
month, drain them, and send them to be
smoked over a wood fire for 3 weeks or a
month. <i>Time.</i>—To remain in the pickle 1
month; to be smoked 3 weeks or 1
month. <i>Sufficient.</i>—The above proportion
of pickle is sufficient for 1 ham.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Hams should be pickled
from October to March.</p>


<h3>HAMS, to Salt Two, about 12 or 15
lbs. each.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of treacle, ½ lb. of
saltpetre, 1 lb. of bay-salt, 2 pounds of
common salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Two days before
they are put into pickle, rub the hams
well with salt, to draw away all slime and
blood. Throw what comes from them
away, and then rub them with treacle,
saltpetre, and salt. Lay them in a deep
pan, and let them remain one day; boil
the above proportion of treacle, saltpetre,
bay-salt, and common salt for ¼ hour, and
pour this pickle boiling hot over the hams:
there should be sufficient of it to cover
them. For a day or two rub them well
with it; afterwards they will only require
turning. They ought to remain in this
pickle for 3 weeks or a month, and then
be sent to be smoked, which will take
nearly or quite a month to do. An ox-tongue
pickled in this way is most excellent,
to be eaten either green or smoked.
<i>Time.</i>—To remain in the pickle 3 weeks
or a month; to be smoked about a month.
<i>Seasonable</i> from October to March.</p>


<h3>HAMS, to Smoke, at Home.</h3>

<p>Take an old hogshead, stop up all the
crevices, and fix a place to put a cross-stick
near the bottom, to hang the articles
to be smoked on. Next, in the side, cut
a hole near the top, to introduce an iron
pan filled with sawdust and small pieces
of green wood. Having turned the tub
upside down, hang the articles upon the
cross-stick, introduce the iron pan in the
opening, and place a piece of red-hot
iron in the pan, cover it with sawdust,
and all will be complete. Let a large
ham remain 40 hours, and keep up a good
smoke. Fish may be smoked in the same
manner.</p>


<h3>HARE, Broiled (a Supper or Luncheon
Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The legs and shoulders
of a roast hare, cayenne and salt to taste,
a little butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the legs and
shoulders from a roast hare, season them
highly with salt and cayenne, and broil
them over a very clear fire for 5 minutes.
Dish them on a hot dish, rub over them
a little cold butter, and send to table very
quickly. <i>Time.</i>—5 minutes. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to the end of February.</p>


<h3>HARE, Hashed.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of cold roast hare, 1 blade of
pounded mace, 2 or 3 allspice, pepper
and salt to taste, 1 onion, a bunch of
savoury herbs, 3 tablespoonfuls of port
wine, thickening of butter and flour, 2
tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut the cold hare into neat slices,
and put the head, bones, and trimmings
into a stewpan, with ¾ pint of water; add
the mace, allspice, seasoning, onion, and
herbs, and stew for nearly an hour, and
strain the gravy; thicken it with butter
and flour, add the wine and ketchup, and
lay in the pieces of hare, with any stuffing
that may be left. Let the whole gradually
heat by the side of the fire, and, when it
has simmered for about 5 minutes, serve,
and garnish the dish with sippets of
toasted bread. Send red-currant jelly to
table with it. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more than
1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the
cold hare, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to the end of February.</p>


<h3>HARE, Jugged (very good).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 hare, 1½ lb. of gravy
beef, ½ lb. of butter, 1 onion, 1 lemon,
6 cloves; pepper, cayenne, and salt to
taste; ½ pint of port wine. <i>Mode.</i>—Skin,
paunch, and wash the hare, cut it
into pieces, dredge them with flour, and
fry in boiling butter. Have ready 1½ pint
of gravy, made from the above proportion
of beef, and thickened with a little flour.
Put this into a jar; add the pieces of
fried hare, an onion stuck with six cloves,
a lemon peeled and cut in half, and a
good seasoning of pepper, cayenne, and
salt; cover the jar down tightly, put it
up to the neck into a stewpan of boiling
water, and let it stew until the hare is
quite tender, taking care to keep the
water boiling. When nearly done, pour
in the wine, and add a few forcemeat
balls: these must be fried or baked in the
oven for a few minutes before they are put
to the gravy. Serve with red-currant jelly.
<i>Time.</i>—3½ to 4 hours. If the hare is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
old, allow 4½ hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to the end of February.</p>


<h3>HARE, Jugged (a Quicker and
more Economical Way).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 hare, a bunch of sweet
herbs, 2 onions, each stuck with 3 cloves,
6 whole allspice, ½ teaspoonful of black
pepper, a strip of lemon-peel, thickening
of butter and flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of
mushroom ketchup, ¼ pint of port wine.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the hare nicely, cut it up
into joints (not too large), and flour and
brown them as in the preceding recipe;
then put them into a stewpan with the
herbs, onions, cloves, allspice, pepper,
and lemon-peel; cover with hot water,
and when it boils, carefully remove all
the scum, and let it simmer gently till
tender, which will be in about 1¾ hour,
or longer, should the hare be very old.
Take out the pieces of hare, thicken the
gravy with flour and butter, add the
ketchup and port wine, let it boil for
about 10 minutes, strain it through a
sieve over the hare, and serve. A few
fried forcemeat balls should be added at
the moment of serving, or, instead of
frying them, they may be stewed in the
gravy, about 10 minutes before the hare
is wanted for table. Do not omit to serve
red-currant jelly with it. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether
2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to the end of February.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Should there be any left, re-warm
it the next day by putting the
hare, &amp;c., into a covered jar, and placing
this jar in a saucepan of boiling water;
this method prevents a great deal of
waste.</p>


<h3>HARE, Potted (a Luncheon or
Breakfast Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 hare, a few slices of
bacon, a large bunch of savoury herbs, 4
cloves, ½ teaspoonful of whole allspice, 2
carrots, 2 onions, salt and pepper to
taste, 1 pint of water, 2 glasses of sherry.
<i>Mode.</i>—Skin, empty, and wash the hare;
cut it down the middle, and put it into a
stewpan, with a few slices of bacon under
and over it; add the remaining ingredients,
and stew very gently until the hare
is tender, and the flesh will separate
easily from the bones. When done
enough, take it up, remove the bones,
and pound the meat, <i>with the bacon</i>, in a
mortar, until reduced to a perfectly
smooth paste. Should it not be sufficiently
seasoned, add a little cayenne,
salt, and pounded mace, but be careful
that these are well mixed with the other
ingredients. Press the meat into potting-pots,
pour over clarified butter, and
keep in a dry place. The liquor that
the hare was stewed in, should be saved
for hashes, soups, &amp;c. &amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—About
2½ hours to stew the hare. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to the end of February.</p>


<h3>HARE, Roast.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/illus-155.jpg" width="246" height="105" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">ROAST HARE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Hare, forcemeat, a little
milk, butter. <i>Choosing and Trussing.</i>—Choose
a young hare; which may be
known by its smooth and sharp claws,
and by the cleft in the lip not being
much spread. To be eaten in perfection,
it must hang for some time; and, if
properly taken care of, it may be kept
for several days. It is better to hang
without being paunched; but should it
be previously emptied, wipe the inside
every day, and sprinkle over it a little
pepper and ginger, to prevent the musty
taste which long keeping in the damp occasions,
and also which affects the stuffing.
After it is skinned, wash it well, and
soak for an hour in warm water to
draw out the blood; if old, let it lie in
vinegar for a short time, but wash it
well afterwards in several waters. Make
a forcemeat, wipe the hare dry, fill the
belly with it, and sew it up. Bring the
hind and fore legs close to the body towards
the head, run a skewer through
each, fix the head between the shoulders
by means of another skewer, and
be careful to leave the ears on. Put a
string round the body from skewer to
skewer, and tie it above the back.
<i>Mode.</i>—The hare should be kept at a
distance from the fire when it is first
laid down, or the outside will become
dry and hard before the inside is done.
Baste it well with milk for a short time,
and afterwards with butter; and particular
attention must be paid to the
basting, so as to preserve the meat on
the back juicy and nutritive. When it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
is almost roasted enough, flour the hare,
and baste well with butter. When nicely
frothed, dish it, remove the skewers,
and send it to table with a little gravy
in the dish, and a tureen of the same.
Red-currant jelly must also not be forgotten,
as this is an indispensable accompaniment
to roast hare. For economy,
good beef dripping may be substituted
for the milk and butter to baste
with; but the basting, as we have before
stated, must be continued without
intermission. If the liver is good, it
may be parboiled, minced, and mixed
with the stuffing; but it should not be
used unless quite fresh. <i>Time.</i>—A middling-sized
hare, 1¼ hour; a large hare,
1½ to 2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, from 4<i>s.</i> to
6<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to the end of February.</p>


<h3>HARE, Roast, to Carve.</h3>

<p>The “Grand Carver” of olden times,
a functionary of no ordinary dignity, was
pleased when he had a hare to manipulate,
for his
skill and
grace had an
opportunity
of display.
<i>Diners à la
Russe</i> may
possibly, erewhile,
save modern gentlemen the necessity
of learning the art which was in auld
lang syne one of the necessary accomplishments
of the youthful squire; but,
until side-tables become universal, or till
we see the office of “grand carver” once
more instituted, it will be well for all to
learn how to assist at the carving of this
dish, which, if not the most elegant in
appearance, is a very general favourite.
The hare, having its head to the left, as
shown in the woodcut, should be first
served by cutting slices from each side
of the backbone, in the direction of the
lines from 3 to 4. After these prime
parts are disposed of, the leg should
next be disengaged by cutting round the
line indicated by the figures 5 to 6. The
shoulders will then be taken off by passing
the knife round from 7 to 8. The
back of the hare should now be divided
by cutting quite through its spine, as
shown by the line 1 to 2, taking care to
feel with the point of the knife for a
joint where the back may be readily
penetrated. It is the usual plan not to
serve any bone in helping hare; and
thus the flesh should be sliced from the
legs and placed alone on the plate. In
large establishments, and where men-cooks
are kept, it is often the case that
the backbone of the hare, especially in
old animals, is taken out, and then the
process of carving is, of course, considerably
facilitated. A great point to
be remembered in connection with carving
hare is, that plenty of gravy should
accompany each helping, otherwise this
dish, which is naturally dry, will lose
half its flavour, and so become a failure.
Stuffing is also served with it; and the
ears, which should be nicely crisp, and
the brains of the hare, are esteemed as
delicacies by many connoisseurs.</p>

<h3>HARE SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A hare fresh-killed, 1 lb.
of lean gravy-beef, a slice of ham, 1
carrot, 2 onions, a faggot of savoury
herbs, ¼ oz. of whole black pepper, a
little browned flour, ¼ pint of port wine,
the crumb of two French rolls, salt and
cayenne to taste, 3 quarts of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Skin and paunch the hare, saving
the liver and as much blood as possible.
Cut it in pieces, and put it in a
stewpan with all the ingredients, and
simmer gently for 6 hours. This soup
should be made the day before it is
wanted. Strain through a sieve, put the
best parts of the hare in the soup, and
serve.</p>


<h3>HARE SOUP.</h3>

<p>Proceed as above; but, instead of putting the
joints of the hare in the soup,
pick the meat from the bones, pound it
in a mortar, and add it, with the crumb
of two French rolls, to the soup. Rub
all through a sieve; heat slowly, but do
not let it boil. Send it to table immediately.
<i>Time.</i>—8 hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to February. <i>Sufficient</i> for 10
persons.</p>


<h3>HERB POWDER, for Flavouring
when Fresh Herbs are not obtainable.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 oz. of dried lemon-thyme,
1 oz. of dried winter savory, 1
oz. of dried sweet marjoram and basil,
2 oz. of dried parsley, 1 oz. of dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
lemon-peel. <i>Mode.</i>—Prepare and dry
the herbs, pick the leaves from the
stalks, pound them, and sift them
through a hair sieve; mix in the above
proportions, and keep in glass bottles,
carefully excluding the air. This we
think a far better method of keeping
herbs, as the flavour and fragrance do
not evaporate so much as when they are
merely put in paper bags. Preparing
them in this way, you have them ready
for use at a moment’s notice. Mint,
sage, parsley, &amp;c., dried, pounded, and
each put into separate bottles, will be
found very useful in winter.</p>


<h3>HERBS, to Dry, for Winter Use.</h3>

<p>On a very dry day, gather the herbs,
just before they begin to flower. If this
is done when the weather is damp, the
herbs will not be so good a colour. (It
is very necessary to be particular in little
matters like this, for trifles constitute
perfection, and herbs nicely dried will be
found very acceptable when frost and
snow are on the ground. It is hardly
necessary, however, to state that the flavour
and fragrance of fresh herbs are incomparably
finer.) They should be perfectly
freed from dirt and dust, and be
divided into small bunches, with their
roots cut off. Dry them quickly in a
very hot oven, or before the fire, as by
this means most of their flavour will be
preserved, and be careful not to burn
them; tie them up in paper bags, and
keep in a dry place. This is a very
general way of preserving dried herbs;
but we would recommend the plan described
in a former recipe. <i>Seasonable.</i>—From
the month of July to the end of
September is the proper time for storing
herbs for winter use.</p>


<h3>HERRINGS, White, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 herrings, 4 bay-leaves,
12 cloves, 12 allspice, 2 small blades of
mace, cayenne pepper and salt to taste,
sufficient vinegar to fill up the dish.
<i>Mode.</i>—Take herrings, cut off the heads,
and gut them. Put them in a pie-dish,
heads and tails alternately, and, between
each layer, sprinkle over the above ingredients.
Cover the fish with the vinegar,
and bake for ½ hour, but do not use
it till quite cold. The herrings may be
cut down the front, the backbone taken
out, and closed again. Sprats done in
this way are very delicious. <i>Time.</i>—½ an
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Choose the Herring.</span>—The more
scales this fish has, the surer the sign
of its freshness. It should also have a
bright and silvery look; but if red about
the head, it is a sign that it has been dead
for some time.</p>


<h3>HERRINGS, Red or YARMOUTH
BLOATERS.</h3>

<p>The best way to cook these is to make
incisions in the skin across the fish, because
they do not then require to be so
long on the fire, and will be far better
than when cut open. The hard roe makes
a nice relish by pounding it in a mortar,
with a little anchovy, and spreading
it on toast. If very dry, soak in warm
water 1 hour before dressing.</p>


<h3>HIDDEN MOUNTAIN, The (a
pretty Supper Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 eggs, a few slices of
citron, sugar to taste, ¼ pint of cream, a
layer of any kind of jam. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat
the whites and yolks of the eggs separately;
then mix them and beat well
again, adding a few thin slices of citron,
the cream, and sufficient pounded sugar
to sweeten it nicely. When the mixture
is well beaten, put it into a buttered pan,
and fry the same as a pancake; but it
should be three times the thickness of an
ordinary pancake. Cover it with jam,
and garnish with slices of citron and
holly-leaves. This dish is served cold.
<i>Time.</i>—About 10 minutes to fry the mixture.
<i>Average cost</i>, with the jam, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>HODGE-PODGE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of shin of beef, 3
quarts of water, 1 pint of table-beer, 2
onions, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 1 head of
celery; pepper and salt to taste; thickening
of butter and flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the
meat, beer, and water in a stewpan; simmer
for a few minutes, and skim carefully.
Add the vegetables and seasoning;
stew gently till the meat is tender.
Thicken with the butter and flour, and
serve with turnips and carrots, or spinach
and celery. <i>Time.</i>—3 hours, or rather
more. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>d.</i> per quart.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time. <i>Sufficient</i> for 12
persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>


<h3>HODGE-PODGE.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—About
1 lb. of underdone cold mutton,
2 lettuces, 1 pint of green peas,
5 or 6 green onions, 2 oz. of butter,
pepper and salt to taste, ½ teacupful
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince the mutton,
and cut up the lettuces and onions in
slices. Put those in a stewpan, with all
the ingredients except the peas, and let
these simmer very gently for ¾ hour,
keeping them well stirred. Boil the peas
separately, mix these with the mutton,
and serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from the end of May to August.</p>


<h3>HOLLY-LEAVES, to Frost, for
Garnishing and Decorating Dessert
and Supper Dishes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sprigs of holly, oiled
butter, coarsely-powdered sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Procure
some nice sprigs of holly;
pick the leaves from the stalks, and wipe
them with a clean cloth free from all
moisture; then place them on a dish
near the fire, to get thoroughly dry, but
not too near to shrivel the leaves; dip
them into oiled butter, sprinkle over
them some coarsely-powdered sugar, and
dry them before the fire. They should
be kept in a dry place, as the least damp
would spoil their appearance. <i>Time.</i>—About
10 minutes to dry before the fire.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—These may be made at any
time; but are more suitable for winter
garnishes, when fresh flowers are not
easily obtained.</p>


<h3>HONEY CAKE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ breakfast-cupful of
sugar, 1 breakfast-cupful of rich sour
cream, 2 breakfast-cupfuls of flour, ½ teaspoonful
of carbonate of soda, honey to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the sugar and cream
together; dredge in the flour, with as
much honey as will flavour the mixture
nicely; stir it well that all the ingredients
may be thoroughly mixed; add the
carbonate of soda, and beat the cake
well for another 5 minutes; put it into a
buttered tin, bake it from ½ to ¾ hour,
and let it be eaten warm. <i>Time.</i>—½ to
¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
3 or 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>HORSERADISH.</h3>

<p>This root, scraped, is always served
with hot roast beef, and is used for garnishing
many kinds of boiled fish. Let
the horseradish remain in cold water for
an hour; wash it well, and with a sharp
knife scrape it into very thin shreds,
commencing from the thick end of the
root. Arrange some of it lightly in a
small glass dish, and the remainder use
for garnishing the joint; it should be
placed in tufts round the border of the
dish, with 1 or 2 bunches on the meat.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>d.</i> per stick. <i>Seasonable</i>
from October to June.</p>


<h3>HORSERADISH SAUCE, to serve
with Roast Beef.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 tablespoonfuls of grated
horseradish, 1 teaspoonful of pounded
sugar, 1 teaspoonful of salt, ½ teaspoonful
of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of made
mustard; vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Grate the
horseradish, and mix it well with the
sugar, salt, pepper, and mustard;
moisten it with sufficient vinegar to give
it the consistency of cream, and serve in
a tureen; 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of cream
added to the above very much improve
the appearance and flavour of this sauce.
To heat it to serve with hot roast beef,
put it in a <i>bain marie</i> or a jar, which
place in a saucepan of boiling water;
make it hot, but do not allow it to boil,
or it will curdle.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This sauce is a great improvement
on the old-fashioned way of serving
cold-scraped horseradish with hot roast
beef. The mixing of the cold vinegar
with the warm gravy cools and spoils
everything on the plate. Of course, with
cold meat, the sauce should be served cold.</p>


<h3>HORSERADISH VINEGAR.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of scraped horseradish,
1 oz. of minced shalot, 1 drachm
of cayenne, 1 quart of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
all the ingredients into a bottle,
which shake well every day for a fortnight.
When it is thoroughly steeped,
strain and bottle, and it will be fit for
use immediately. This will be found an
agreeable relish to cold beef, &amp;c. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This
vinegar should be made either
in October or November, as horseradish
is then in its highest perfection.</p>


<h3>HOT SPICE (a Delicious Adjunct
to Chops, Steaks, Gravies, &amp;c.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 drachms each of ginger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
black pepper, and cinnamon, 7
cloves, ½ oz. mace, ¼ oz. of cayenne, 1 oz.
grated nutmeg, 1½ oz. white pepper.
<i>Mode.</i>—Pound the ingredients, and mix
them thoroughly together, taking care
that everything is well blended. Put the
spice in a very dry glass bottle for use.
The quantity of cayenne may be increased,
should the above not be enough
to suit the palate.</p>


<h3>ICE-CREAMS, Fruit.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every pint of fruit-juice
allow 1 pint of cream; sugar to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the fruit be well
ripened; pick it off the stalks, and put
it into a large earthen pan. Stir it about
with a wooden spoon, breaking it until it
is well mashed; then, with the back of
the spoon, rub it through a hair sieve.
Sweeten it nicely with pounded sugar;
whip the cream for a few minutes, add it
to the fruit, and whisk the whole again
for another 5 minutes. Put the mixture
into the freezing-pot, and freeze, taking
care to stir the cream, &amp;c., two or three
times, and to remove it from the sides of
the vessel, that the mixture may be equally
frozen and smooth. Ices are usually
served in glasses, but if moulded, as they
sometimes are for dessert, must have a
small quantity of melted isinglass added
to them, to enable them to keep their
shape. Raspberry, strawberry, currant,
and all fruit ice-creams, are made in the
same manner. A little pounded sugar
sprinkled over the fruit before it is
mashed assists to extract the juice. In
winter, when fresh fruit is not obtainable,
a little jam may be substituted for it: it
should be melted and worked through a
sieve before being added to the whipped
cream; and if the colour should not be
good, a little prepared, cochineal or beetroot
may be put in to improve its
appearance. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour to freeze the
mixture. <i>Average cost</i>, with cream at
1<i>s.</i> per pint, 4<i>d.</i> each ice. <i>Seasonable</i>,
with fresh fruit, in June, July, and
August.</p>


<h3>ICE, Lemon-water.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every pint of syrup,
allow 1/3 pint of lemon-juice; the rind of
4 lemons. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub the sugar on the
rinds of the lemons, and with it make the
syrup. Strain the lemon-juice, add it to the
other ingredients, stir well, and put the
mixture into a freezing-pot. Freeze as
directed for Ice Pudding, and when the
mixture is thoroughly and equally frozen,
put it into ice-glasses. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour to
freeze the mixture. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>d.</i> to
4<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<div class="caption">ICED-PUDDING MOULD.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of sweet almonds,
2 oz. of bitter ones, ¾ lb, of sugar, 8 eggs,
1½ pint of milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch and
dry the almonds thoroughly in a cloth,
then pound them in a mortar until reduced
to a smooth paste; add to these
the well-beaten eggs, the sugar, and
milk; stir these ingredients over the fire
until they thicken, but do not allow them
to boil; then strain and put the mixture
into the freezing-pot; surround it with
ice, and freeze it. When quite frozen,
fill an iced-pudding mould, put on the
lid, and keep the pudding in ice until
required for table; then turn it out on
the dish, and garnish it with a <i>compôte</i> or
any fruit that may be preferred, pouring
a little over the top of the pudding.
This pudding may be flavoured with
vanilla, Curaçoa, or Maraschino. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour to freeze the mixture. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Served
all the year round.</p>


<h3>ICES.</h3>

<p>Ices are composed, it is scarcely necessary
to say, of congealed cream or water,
combined sometimes with liqueurs or
other flavouring ingredients, or more
generally with the juices of fruits. At
desserts, or at some evening parties, ices
are scarcely to be dispensed with. The
principal utensils required for making
ice-creams are ice-tubs, freezing-pots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
spaddles, and a cellaret. The tub must
be large enough to contain about a bushel
of ice, pounded small, when brought out
of the ice-house, and mixed very carefully
with either <i>salt</i>, <i>nitre</i>, or <i>soda</i>.
The freezing-pot is best made of pewter.
If it be of tin, as is sometimes the case,
the congelation goes on too rapidly in it
for the thorough intermingling of its contents,
on which the excellence of the ice
greatly depends. The spaddle is generally
made of copper, kept bright and
clean. The cellaret is a tin vessel, in
which ices are kept for a short time from
dissolving. The method to be pursued in
the freezing process must be attended to.
When the ice-tub is prepared with fresh-pounded
ice and salt, the freezing-pot is
put into it up to its cover. The articles
to be congealed are then poured into it
and covered over; but to prevent the
ingredients from separating and the
heaviest of them from falling to the bottom
of the mould, it is requisite to turn
the freezing-pot round and round by the
handle, so as to keep its contents moving
until the congelation commences. As
soon as this is perceived (the cover of the
pot being occasionally taken off for the
purpose of noticing when freezing takes
place), the cover is immediately closed
over it, ice is put upon it, and it is left
in this state till it is served. The use of
the spaddle is to stir up and remove from
the sides of the freezing-pot the cream,
which in the shaking may have washed
against it, and by stirring it in with the
rest, to prevent waste of it occurring.
Any negligence in stirring the contents
of the freezing-pot before congelation
takes place, will destroy the whole: either
the sugar sinks to the bottom and leaves
the ice insufficiently sweetened, or lumps
are formed, which disfigure and discolour
it.</p>


<h3>ICES, to make Fruit-water.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every pint of fruit-juice
allow 1 pint of syrup. <i>Mode.</i>—Select
nice ripe fruit; pick off the stalks
and put it into a large earthen pan, with
a little pounded sugar strewed over; stir
it about with a wooden spoon until it
is well broken, then rub it through a
hair sieve. Make a syrup, without white
of egg; let it cool add the fruit-juice,
mix well together, and put the mixture
into the freezing-pot. Proceed as directed
for Ice Puddings, and when the
mixture is equally frozen, put it into small
glasses.  Raspberry, strawberry, currant,
and other fresh-fruit-water ices, are
made in the same manner. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour to freeze the mixture. <i>Average cost</i>,
3<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i>, with fresh
fruit, in June, July, and August.</p>

<h3>ICING, Almond, for Cakes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of finely-pounded
loaf sugar, allow 1 lb. of sweet
almonds, the whites of 4 eggs, a little
rosewater. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch the almonds,
and pound them (a few at a time) in a
mortar to a paste, adding a little rosewater
to facilitate the operation. Whisk
the whites of the eggs to a strong froth;
mix them with the pounded almonds,
stir in the sugar, and beat altogether.
When the cake is sufficiently baked, lay
on the almond icing, and put it into the
oven to dry. Before laying this preparation
on the cake, great care must be
taken that it is nice and smooth, which
is easily accomplished by well beating the
mixture.</p>


<h3>ICING, Sugar, for Cakes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of loaf
sugar allow the whites of 4 eggs, 1 oz. of
fine starch. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat the eggs to a
strong froth, and gradually sift in the
sugar, which should be reduced to the
finest possible powder, and gradually add
the starch, also finely powdered. Beat
the mixture well until the sugar is
smooth; then with a spoon or broad
knife lay the ice equally over the cakes.
These should then be placed in a very
cool oven, and the icing allowed to dry
and harden, but not to colour. The
icing may be coloured with strawberry or
currant juice, or with prepared cochineal.
If it be put on the cakes as soon
as they are withdrawn from the oven, it
will become firm and hard by the time
the cakes are cold. On very rich cakes,
such as wedding, christening cakes, &amp;c.,
a layer of almond icing is usually spread
over the top, and over that the white
icing as described. All iced cakes should
be kept in a very dry place.</p>

<h3>INVALID COOKERY.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A few Rules to be observed in Cooking
for Invalids.</i></p>

<p>Let all the kitchen utensils used in the
preparation of invalids’ cookery be delicately
and <i>scrupulously clean</i>; if this is
not the case, a disagreeable flavour may
be imparted to the preparation, which
flavour may disgust, and prevent the patient
from partaking of the refreshment
when brought to him or her.</p>

<p>For invalids, never make a large quantity
<i>of one thing</i>, as they seldom require
much at a time; and it is desirable that
variety be provided for them.</p>

<p>Always have something in readiness;
a little beef tea, nicely made and nicely
skimmed, a few spoonfuls of jelly, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., that it may be administered as soon
almost as the invalid wishes for it. If
obliged to wait a long time, the patient
loses the desire to eat, and often turns
against the food when brought to him or
her.</p>

<p>In sending dishes or preparations up
to invalids, let everything look as tempting
as possible. Have a clean tray-cloth
laid smoothly over the tray; let the
spoons, tumblers, cups and saucers, &amp;c.,
be very clean and bright. Gruel served
in a tumbler is more appetizing than
when served in a basin or cup and saucer.</p>

<p>As milk is an important article of food
for the sick, in warm weather let it be
kept on ice, to prevent its turning sour.
Many other delicacies may also be preserved
good in the same manner for some
little time.</p>

<p>If the patient be allowed to eat vegetables,
never send them up undercooked,
or half raw; and let a small quantity
only be temptingly arranged on a dish.
This rule will apply to every preparation,
as an invalid is much more likely to
enjoy his food if small delicate pieces are
served to him.</p>

<p>Never leave food about a sick-room; if
the patient cannot eat it when brought
to him, take it away, and bring it to him
in an hour or two’s time. Miss Nightingale
says, “To leave the patient’s untasted
food by his side from meal to
meal, in hopes that he will eat it in the
interval, is simply to prevent him from
taking any food at all.” She says, “I
have known patients literally incapacitated
from taking one article of food after
another by this piece of ignorance. Let
the food come at the right time, and be
taken away, eaten or uneaten, at the
right time, but never let a patient have
‘something always standing’ by him, if
you don’t wish to disgust him of everything.”</p>

<p>Never serve beef tea or broth with the
<i>smallest particle</i> of fat or grease on the
surface. It is better, after making either
of these, to allow them to get perfectly
cold, when <i>all the fat</i> may be easily removed;
then warm up as much as may
be required. Two or three pieces of clean
whity-brown paper laid on the broth will
absorb any greasy particles that may be
floating at the top, as the grease will
cling to the paper.</p>

<p>Roast mutton, chickens, rabbits, calves’
feet or head, game, fish (simply dressed),
and simple puddings, are all light food,
and easily digested. Of course, these
things are only partaken of supposing
the patient is recovering.</p>

<p>A mutton chop, nicely cut, trimmed,
and broiled to a turn, is a dish to be recommended
for invalids; but it must not
be served <i>with all the fat</i> at the end, nor
must it be too thickly cut. Let it be
cooked over a fire free from smoke, and
sent up with the gravy in it, between two
very hot plates. Nothing is more disagreeable
to an invalid than <i>smoked</i> food.</p>

<p>In making toast-and-water, never
blacken the bread, but toast it only a
nice brown. Never leave toast-and-water
to make until the moment it is required,
as it cannot then be properly prepared,—at
least the patient will be obliged to
drink it warm, which is anything but
agreeable.</p>

<p>In boiling eggs for invalids, let the
white be just set; if boiled hard, they
will be likely to disagree with the patient.</p>

<p>In Miss Nightingale’s admirable
“Notes on Nursing,” a book that no
mother or nurse should be without, she
says,—“You cannot be too careful as to
quality in sick-diet. A nurse should
never put before a patient milk that is
sour, meat or soup that is turned, an egg
that is bad, or vegetables underdone.”
Yet often, she says, she has seen these
things brought in to the sick, in a state
perfectly perceptible to every nose or eye
except the nurse’s. It is here that the
clever nurse appears,—she will not bring
in the peccant article; but, not to disappoint
the patient, she will whip up something
else in a few minutes. Remember,
that sick-cookery should half do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
work of your poor patient’s weak digestion.</p>

<p>She goes on to caution nurses, by
saying,—“Take care not to spill into
your patient’s saucer; in other words,
take care that the outside bottom rim of
his cup shall be quite dry and clean. If,
every time he lifts his cup to his lips, he
has to carry the saucer with it, or else to
drop the liquid upon and to soil his sheet,
or bedgown, or pillow, or, if he is sitting
up, his dress, you have no idea what a
difference this minute want of care on
your part makes to his comfort, and even
to his willingness for food.”</p>


<h3>INVALID’S CUTLET.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 nice cutlet from a loin
or neck of mutton; 2 teacupfuls of water;
1 very small stick of celery; pepper and
salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Have the cutlet
cut from a very nice loin or neck of mutton,
take off all the fat, put it into a
stewpan with the other ingredients; stew
very gently indeed for nearly 2 hours,
and skim off every particle of fat that
may rise to the surface from time to time.
The celery should be out into thin slices
before it is added to the meat, and care
must be taken not to put in too much of
this, or the dish will not be good. If the
water is allowed to boil fast, the cutlet
will be hard. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours very
gentle stewing. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for one person. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Whenever
celery may be had.</p>


<h3>INVALID’S JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 shanks of mutton, 3
quarts of water, a bunch of sweet herbs,
pepper and salt to taste, 3 blades of mace,
1 onion, 1 lb. of lean beef, a crust of
bread toasted brown. <i>Mode.</i>—Soak the
shanks in plenty of water for some hours,
and scrub them well; put them, with the
beef and other ingredients, into a saucepan
with the water, and let them simmer
very gently for 5 hours. Strain the broth,
and, when cold, take off all the fat. It
may be eaten either warmed up or cold
as a jelly. <i>Time.</i>—5 hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to make from 1½ to 2 pints
of jelly. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>INVALIDS, Lemonade for.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lemon, lump sugar to
taste, 1 pint of boiling water. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare
off the rind of the lemon thinly;
cut the lemon into 2 or 3 thick slices,
and remove as much as possible of the
white outside pith, and all the pips. Put
the slices of lemon, the peel, and lump
sugar into a jug; pour over the boiling
water; cover it closely, and in 2 hours it
will be fit to drink. It should either be
strained or poured off from the sediment.
<i>Time.</i>—2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
to make 1 pint of lemonade. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>JAM ROLY-POLY PUDDING.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ lb. of suet-crust, ¾ lb.
of any kind of jam. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a nice
light suet-crust, and roll it out to the thickness
of about ½ inch. Spread the jam
equally over it, leaving a small margin
of paste without any, where the pudding
joins. Roll it up, fasten the ends securely,
and tie it in a floured cloth; put
the pudding into boiling water, and boil
for 2 hours. Mincemeat or marmalade
may be substituted for the jam, and
makes excellent puddings. <i>Time.</i>—2
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Suitable
for winter puddings, when fresh fruit is
not obtainable.</p>

until quite firm. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour to
boil the isinglass and water; about 10
minutes to stir the mixture in the jug.

<h3>JELLIES</h3>

<p>Are not the nourishing food they were
at one time considered to be, and many
eminent physicians are of opinion that
they are less digestible than the flesh, or
muscular part of animals; still, when
acidulated with lemon-juice and flavoured
with wine, they are very suitable
for some convalescents. Vegetable jelly
is a distinct principle, existing in fruits,
which possesses the property of gelatinizing
when boiled and cooled; but it is a
principle entirely different from the gelatine
of animal bodies, although the
name of jelly, common to both, sometimes
leads to an erroneous idea on that
subject. Animal jelly, or gelatine, is
glue, whereas vegetable jelly is rather
analogous to gum. Liebig places gelatine
very low indeed in the scale of usefulness.
He says, “Gelatine, which by itself is
tasteless, and when eaten, excites nausea,
possesses no nutritive value; that,
even when accompanied by the savoury
constituents of flesh, it is not capable of
supporting the vital process, and when
added to the usual diet as a substitute
for plastic matter, does not increase, but
on the contrary, diminishes the nutritive
value of the food, which it renders insufficient
in quantity and inferior in quality.”
It is this substance which is most
frequently employed in the manufacture
of the jellies supplied by the confectioner;
but those prepared at home from
calves’ feet do possess some nutrition,
and are the only sort that should be
given to invalids. Isinglass is the purest
variety of gelatine, and is prepared from
the sounds or swimming-bladders of certain
fish, chiefly the sturgeon. From
its whiteness it is mostly used for making
blancmange and similar dishes.</p>


<h3>JELLIES, Bottled, How to Mould.</h3>

<p>Uncork the bottle; place it in a saucepan
of hot water until the jelly is reduced
to a liquid state; taste it, to ascertain
whether it is sufficiently flavoured, and
if not, add a little wine. Pour the jelly
into moulds which have been soaked in
water; let it set, and turn it out by
placing the mould in hot water for a
minute; then wipe the outside, put a
dish on the top, and turn it over quickly.
The jelly should then slip easily away
from the mould, and be quite firm. It
may be garnished as taste dictates.</p>


<h3>JELLY, Isinglass, or Gelatine.</h3>

<p>(Substitutes for Calf’s Feet.)</p>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 oz. of isinglass or gelatine,
2 quarts of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the isinglass or gelatine into a saucepan
with the above proportion of cold water;
bring it quickly to boil, and let it boil
very fast, until the liquor is reduced one-half.
Carefully remove the scum as it
rises, then strain it through a jelly-bag,
and it will be ready for use. If not required
very clear, it may be merely
strained through a fine sieve, instead of
being run through a bag. Rather more
than ½ oz. of isinglass is about the proper
quantity to use for a quart of strong
calf’s-feet stock, and rather more than
2 oz. for the same quantity of fruit juice.
As isinglass varies so much in quality
and strength, it is difficult to give the
exact proportions. The larger the mould,
the stiffer should be the jelly; and where
there is no ice, more isinglass must be
used than if the mixture were frozen.
This forms a stock for all kinds of jellies,
which may be flavoured in many ways.
<i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Sufficient</i>, with wine,
syrup, fruit, &amp;c., to fill two moderate-sized
moulds. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The above, when boiled, should
be perfectly clear, and may be mixed
warm with wine, flavourings, fruits, &amp;c.,
and then run through the bag.</p>


<h3>JELLY-BAG, How to make a.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 183px;">
<img src="images/illus-165.jpg" width="183" height="260" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">JELLY-BAG.</div>
</div>

<p>The very stout flannel called double-mill,
used for ironing-blankets,
is the
best material for a
jelly-bag: those of
home manufacture
are the only ones
to be relied on for
thoroughly clearing
the jelly. Care
should be taken
that the seam of
the bag be stitched
twice, to secure it
against unequal
filtration. The
most convenient mode of using the bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
is to tie it upon a hoop the exact size
of the outside of its mouth; and, to
do this, strings should be sewn round
it at equal distances. The jelly-bag
may, of course, be made any size; but
one of twelve or fourteen inches deep,
and seven or eight across the mouth, will
be sufficient for ordinary use. The form
of a jelly-bag is the fool’s-cap.</p>


<h3>JELLY Moulded with fresh Fruit,
or Macedoine de Fruits.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Rather more than 1½ pint
of jelly, a few nice strawberries, or red
or white currants, or raspberries, or any
fresh fruit that may be in season. <i>Mode.</i>—Have
ready the above proportion of
jelly, which must be very clear and
rather sweet, the raw fruit requiring an
additional quantity of sugar. Select
ripe, nice-looking fruit; pick off the
stalks, unless currants are used, when
they are laid in the jelly as they come
from the tree. Begin by putting a little
jelly at the bottom of the mould, which
must harden; then arrange the fruit
round the sides of the mould, recollecting
that <i>it will be reversed when turned
out</i>; then pour in some more jelly to
make the fruit adhere, and, when that
layer is set, put another row of fruit and
jelly until the mould is full. If convenient,
put it in ice until required for
table, then wring a cloth in boiling
water, wrap it round the mould for a
minute, and turn the jelly carefully out.
Peaches, apricots, plums, apples, &amp;c.,
are better for being boiled in a little clear
syrup before they are laid in the jelly;
strawberries, raspberries, grapes, cherries,
and currants are put in raw. In
winter, when fresh fruits are not obtainable,
a very pretty jelly may be
made with preserved fruits or brandy
cherries: these, in a bright and clear
jelly, have a very pretty effect; of
course, unless the jelly be <i>very clear</i>, the
beauty of the dish will be spoiled. It
may be garnished with the same fruit as
is laid in the jelly; for instance, an open
jelly with strawberries might have, piled
in the centre, a few of the same fruit
prettily arranged, or a little whipped
cream might be substituted for the fruit.
<i>Time.</i>—One layer of jelly should remain 2
hours in a very cool place, before another
layer is added. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i>, with fruit, to fill a quart
mould. <i>Seasonable</i>, with fresh fruit, from
June to October; with dried, at any
time.</p>

<h3>JELLY, ORANGE, Moulded with
slices of Orange.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of orange jelly,
4 oranges, ½ pint of clarified syrup,
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil ½ lb. of loaf sugar with ½
pint of water until there is no scum left
(which must be carefully removed as fast
as it rises), and carefully peel the
oranges; divide them into thin slices,
without breaking the thin skin, and put
these pieces of orange into the syrup,
where let them remain for about 5 minutes;
then take them out, and use the
syrup for the jelly. When the oranges
are well drained, and the jelly is nearly
cold, pour a little of the latter into the
bottom of the mould; then lay in a few
pieces of orange; over these pour a little
jelly, and when this is set, place another
layer of oranges, proceeding in this manner
until the mould is full. Put it in
ice, or in a cool place, and, before turning
it out, wrap a cloth round the mould
for a minute or two, which has been
wrung out in boiling water. <i>Time.</i>—5
minutes to simmer the oranges, <i>Average
cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>, with the slices of
orange, to fill a quart mould. <i>Seasonable</i>
from November to May.</p>


<h3>JELLY of Two Colours.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 286px;">
<img src="images/illus-166b.jpg" width="286" height="130" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">JELLY OF TWO COLOURS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of calf’s-feet
jelly, a few drops of prepared cochineal.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make 1½ pint of calf’s-feet jelly,
or, if wished more economical, of clarified
syrup and gelatine, flavouring it in
any way that may be preferred. Colour
one-half of the jelly with a few drops of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
prepared cochineal, and the other half
leave as pale as possible. Have ready
a mould well wetted in every part; pour
in a small quantity of the red jelly, and
let this set; when quite firm, pour on it
the same quantity of the pale jelly, and
let this set; then proceed in this manner
until the mould is full, always taking
care to let one jelly set before the other
is poured in, or the colours would run
one into the other. When turned out,
the jelly should have a striped appearance.
For variety, half the mould may
be filled at once with one of the jellies,
and, when firm, filled up with the other:
this, also, has a very pretty effect, and
is more expeditiously prepared than
when the jelly is poured in small quantities
into the mould. Blancmange and
red jelly, or blancmange and raspberry
cream, moulded in the above manner,
look very well. The layers of blancmange
and jelly should be about an inch
in depth, and each layer should be perfectly
hardened before another is added.
Half a mould of blancmange and half a
mould of jelly are frequently served in
the same manner. A few pretty dishes
may be made, in this way, of jellies or
blancmanges left from the preceding
day, by melting them separately in a jug
placed in a saucepan of boiling water,
and then moulding them by the foregoing
directions. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour to make the
jelly. <i>Average cost</i>, with calf’s-feet jelly,
2<i>s.</i>; with gelatine and syrup, more economical.
<i>Sufficient</i> to fill 1½-pint mould.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—In making the jelly, use for
flavouring a very pale sherry, or the colour
will be too dark to contrast nicely
with the red jelly.</p>


<h3>JELLY, Open, with whipped
Cream (a very pretty dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of jelly, ½ pint
of cream, 1 glass of sherry, sugar to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Make the above proportion
of calf’s-feet or isinglass jelly,
colouring and flavouring it in any way
that may be preferred; soak a mould,
open in the centre, for about ½ hour in
cold water; fill it with the jelly, and let
it remain in a cool place until perfectly
set; then turn it out on a dish; fill the
centre with whipped cream, flavoured
with sherry and sweetened with pounded
sugar; pile this cream high in the centre,
and serve. The jelly should be
made of rather a dark colour, to contrast
nicely with the cream. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill
1½-pint mould. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<div class="caption">OPEN JELLY WITH WHIPPED CREAM.</div>
</div>


<h3>JELLY, Savoury, for Meat Pies.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 lbs. of shin of beef, 1
calf’s-foot, 3 lbs. of knuckle of veal, poultry
trimmings (if for game pies, any
game trimmings), 2 onions stuck with
cloves, 2 carrots, 4 shalots, a bunch of
savoury herbs, 2 bay-leaves; when liked,
2 blades of mace and a little spice; 2
slices of lean ham; rather more than 2
quarts of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the
meat and put it into a stewpan with all
the ingredients except the water; set it
over a slow fire to draw down, and, when
the gravy ceases to flow from the meat,
pour in the water. Let it boil up, then
carefully take away all scum from the
top. Cover the stewpan closely, and let
the stock simmer very gently for 4 hours:
if rapidly boiled, the jelly will not be
clear. When done, strain it through a
fine sieve or flannel bag; and when cold,
the jelly should be quite transparent. If
this is not the case, clarify it with the
whites of eggs. <i>Time.</i>—4 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, for this quantity, 5<i>s.</i></p>


<h3>JELLY, to make the Stock for, and
to Clarify it.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 calf’s feet, 6 pints of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—The stock for jellies
should always be made the day before it
is required for use, as the liquor has time
to cool, and the fat can be so much more
easily and effectually removed when
thoroughly set. Procure 2 nice calf’s
feet; scald them, to take off the hair;
slit them in two, remove the fat from
between the claws, and wash the feet
well in warm water; put them into a
stewpan, with the above proportion of
cold water, bring it gradually to boil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and remove every particle of scum as it
rises. When it is well skimmed, boil it
very gently for 6 or 7 hours, or until the
liquor is reduced rather more than half;
then strain it through a sieve into a
basin, and put it in a cool place to set.
As the liquor is strained, measure it, to
ascertain the proportion for the jelly,
allowing something for the sediment and
fat at the top. To clarify it, carefully
remove all the fat from the top, pour
over a little warm water, to wash away
any that may remain, and wipe the jelly
with a clean cloth; remove the jelly from
the sediment, put it into a saucepan,
and, supposing the quantity to be a quart,
add to it 6 oz. of loaf sugar, the shells and
well-whisked whites of 5 eggs, and stir
these ingredients together cold; set the
saucepan on the fire, but <i>do not stir the
jelly after it begins to warm.</i> Let it boil
about 10 minutes after it rises to a head,
then throw in a teacupful of cold water;
let it boil 5 minutes longer, then take
the saucepan off, cover it closely, and let
it remain ½ hour near the fire. Dip the
jelly-bag into hot water, wring it out
quite dry, and fasten it on to a stand or
the back of a chair, which must be placed
near the fire, to prevent the jelly from
setting before it has run through the bag.
Place a basin underneath to receive the
jelly; then pour it into the bag, and
should it not be clear the first time, run
it through the bag again. This stock is
the foundation of all <i>really good</i> jellies,
which may be varied in innumerable
ways, by colouring and flavouring with
liqueurs, and by moulding it with fresh
and preserved fruits. To insure the jelly
being firm when turned out, ½ oz. of isinglass
clarified might be added to the
above proportion of stock. Substitutes
for calf’s feet are now frequently used in
making jellies, which lessen the expense
and trouble in preparing this favourite
dish, isinglass and gelatine being two of
the principal materials employed; but
although they may <i>look</i> as nicely as jellies
made from good stock, they are never so
delicate, having very often an unpleasant
flavour, somewhat resembling glue, particularly
when made with gelatine. <i>Time.</i>—About
6 hours to boil the feet for the
stock; to clarify it,—¼ hour to boil, ½
hour to stand in the saucepan covered.
<i>Average cost.</i>—Calf’s feet may be purchased
for 6<i>d.</i> each when veal is in full
season, but more expensive when it is
scarce. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2 calf’s feet should
make 1 quart of stock. <i>Seasonable</i> from
March to October, but may be had all
the year.</p>

<h3>JOHN DORY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—-¼ lb. of salt to each gallon
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—This fish, which
is esteemed by most people a great delicacy,
is dressed in the same way as a
turbot, which it resembles in firmness,
but not in richness. Cleanse it thoroughly
and cut off the fins; lay it in a fish-kettle,
cover with cold water, and add
salt in the above proportion. Bring it
gradually to a boil, and simmer gently
for ¼ hour, or rather longer, should the
fish be very large. Serve on a hot napkin,
and garnish with cut lemon and
parsley. Lobster, anchovy, or shrimp
sauce, and plain melted butter, should
be sent to table with it. <i>Time.</i>—After
the water boils, ¼ to ½ hour, according
to size. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year, but best from September
to January.</p>

<h3>JULIENNE, Soup à la.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 183px;">
<img src="images/illus-172.jpg" width="183" height="261" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">STRIPS OF VEGETABLE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of carrots, ½ pint
of turnips, ¼ pint of onions, 2 or 3 leeks,
½ head of celery, 1 lettuce, a little sorrel
and chervil, if liked, 2 oz. of butter,
2 quarts of stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the vegetables
into strips of about 1¼ inch long,
and be particular they are all the same
size, or some will be hard whilst the
others will be done to a pulp. Cut the
lettuce, sorrel, and chervil into larger
pieces; fry the carrots
in the butter,
and pour the stock
boiling to them.
When this is done,
add all the other
vegetables and
herbs, and stew
gently for at least
an hour. Skim off
all the fat, pour the
soup over thin slices
of bread, cut round
about the size of a
shilling, and serve.
<i>Time.</i>—1½ hour.
<i>Average cost.</i>—1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—In summer, green peas, asparagus-tops,
French beans, &amp;c., can be
added. When the vegetables are very
strong, instead of frying them in butter
at first, they should be blanched, and
afterwards simmered in the stock.</p>


<h3>KALE BROSE (a Scotch Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Half an ox-head or cow-heel,
a teacupful of toasted oatmeal, salt
to taste, 2 handfuls of greens, 3 quarts
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a broth of the
ox-head or cow-heel, and boil it till oil
floats on the top of the liquor, then boil
the greens, shred, in it. Put the oatmeal,
with a little salt, into a basin, and
mix with it quickly a teacupful of the
fat broth: it should not run into one
doughy mass, but form knots. Stir it
into the whole, give one boil, and serve
very hot. <i>Time.</i>—4 hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
8<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year,
but more suitable in winter. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 10 persons.</p>


<h3>KEGEREE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Any cold fish, 1 teacupful
of boiled rice, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful
of mustard, 2 soft-boiled eggs,
salt and cayenne to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick
the fish carefully from the bones, mix
with the other ingredients, and serve
very hot. The quantities may be varied
according to the amount of fish used.
<i>Time.</i>—¼ hour after the rice is boiled.
<i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> exclusive of the fish.</p>


<h3>KIDNEYS, Broiled (a Breakfast or
Supper Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sheep kidneys, pepper
and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
that the kidneys are fresh, and cut them
open, very evenly, lengthwise, down to
the root, for should one half be thicker
than the other, one would be underdone
whilst the other would be dried, but do
not separate them; skin them, and pass
a skewer under the white part of each
half to keep them flat, and broil over a
nice clear fire, placing the inside downwards;
turn them when done enough on
one side, and cook them on the other.
Remove the skewers, place the kidneys
on a very hot dish, season with pepper
and salt, and put a tiny piece of butter
in the middle of each; serve very hot
and quickly, and send very hot plates to
table. <i>Time.</i>—6 to 8 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1½<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1 for
each person. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/illus-173a.jpg" width="216" height="69" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">KIDNEYS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A prettier dish than the above
may be made by serving the kidneys each
on a piece of buttered toast cut in any
fanciful shape. In this case a little
lemon-juice will be found an improvement.</p>


<h3>KIDNEYS, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Kidneys, butter, pepper,
and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the kidneys
open without quite dividing them, remove
the skin, and put a small piece of
butter in the frying-pan. When the
butter is melted, lay in the kidneys the
flat side downwards, and fry them for 7
or 8 minutes, turning them when they
are half done. Serve on a piece of dry
toast, season with pepper and salt, and
put a small piece of butter in each
kidney; pour the gravy from the pan
over them, and serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—7
or 8 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1½<i>d.</i> each.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1 kidney to each person.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>KIDNEY OMELET (a favourite
French Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of
salt, ½ saltspoonful of pepper, 2 sheep’s
kidneys, or 2 tablespoonfuls of minced
veal kidney, 5 oz. of butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Skin
the kidneys, cut them into small
dice, and toss them in a frying-pan, in
1 oz. of butter, over the fire for 2 or 3
minutes. Mix the ingredients for the
omelet, and when the eggs are well
whisked, stir in the pieces of kidney.
Make the butter hot in the frying-pan,
and when it bubbles, pour in the omelet,
and fry it over a gentle fire from 4 to 6
minutes. When the eggs are set, fold
the edges over, so that the omelet assumes
an oval form, and be careful that
it is not too much done: to brown the
top, hold the pan before the fire for a
minute or two, or use a salamander until
the desired colour is obtained, but never
turn an omelet in the pan. Slip it carefully
on to a <i>very hot</i> dish, or, what is a
much safer method, put a dish on the
omelet, and turn the pan quickly over.
It should be served the instant it comes
from the fire. <i>Time.</i>—4 to 6 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 237px;">

<div class="caption">OMELET PAN.</div>
</div>


<h3>KIDNEYS, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—About 8 kidneys, a large
dessertspoonful of chopped herbs, 2 oz.
butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, a little
gravy, juice of half a lemon, a teaspoonful
of Harvey sauce and mushroom
ketchup, cayenne, and salt to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Strew the herbs, with
cayenne and salt, over the kidneys, melt
the butter in the frying-pan, put in the
kidneys, and brown them nicely all
round; when nearly done, stir in the
flour, and shake them well; now add
the gravy and sauce, and stew them for
a few minutes, then turn them out into
a dish garnished with fried sippets.
<i>Time.</i>—10 or 12 minutes. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>LAMB.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 187px;">
<img src="images/illus-174.jpg" width="187" height="533" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">SIDE OF LAMB.</div>
</div>

<p>The most delicious sorts of lamb are
those of the South-Down breed, known
by their black feet; and of these, those
which have been exclusively suckled on
the milk of the parent ewe, are considered
the finest. Next to these in estimation
are those fed on the milk of
several dams; and last of all, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the fattest, the grass-fed lamb: this,
however, implies an age much greater
than either of the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb</span>, in the early part of the season,
however reared, is
in London, and
indeed generally,
sold in quarters,
divided with eleven
ribs to the fore-quarter;
but, as
the season advances,
these are
subdivided into
two, and the hind-quarter
in the same
manner; the first
consisting of the
shoulder, and the
neck and breast;
the latter, of the
leg and the loin.—As
lamb, from the
juicy nature of its
flesh, is especially
liable to spoil in
unfavourable weather,
it should be
frequently wiped,
so as to remove
any moisture that
may form on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Purchasing
of Lamb
for the Table</span>, there are certain signs by
which the experienced judgment is able
to form an accurate opinion whether the
animal has been lately slaughtered, and
whether the joints possess that condition
of fibre indicative of good and wholesome
meat. The first of these doubts
may be solved satisfactorily by the bright
and dilated appearance of the eye; the
quality of the fore-quarter can always be
guaranteed by the blue or healthy ruddiness
of the jugular, or vein of the neck;
while the rigidity of the knuckle, and the
firm, compact feel of the kidney, will
answer in an equally positive manner for
the integrity of the hind-quarter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mode of cutting up a Side of
Lamb in London.</span>—1. Ribs; 2. Breast;
3. Shoulder; 4. Loin; 5. Leg; 1, 2, 3.
Fore Quarter.</p>


<h3>LAMB, Breast of, and Green Peas.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 breast of lamb, a few
slices of bacon, ½ pint of stock, 1 lemon,
1 onion, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, green-peas.
<i>Mode.</i>—Remove the skin from a
breast of lamb, put it into a saucepan of
boiling water, and let it simmer for 5
minutes. Take it out and lay it in cold
water. Line the bottom of a stewpan
with a few thin slices of bacon; lay the
lamb on these; peel the lemon, cut it
into slices, and put these on the meat,
to keep it white and make it tender;
cover with 1 or 2 more slices of bacon;
add the stock, onion, and herbs, and set
it on a slow fire to simmer very gently
until tender. Have ready some green
peas, put these on a dish, and place the
lamb on the top of them. The appearance
of this dish may be much improved
by glazing the lamb, and spinach may be
substituted for the peas when variety is
desired. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
10<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 persons.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Grass lamb, from Easter to
Michaelmas.</p>


<h3>LAMB, Stewed Breast of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 breast of lamb, pepper
and salt to taste, sufficient stock to cover
it, 1 glass of sherry, thickening of butter
and flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Skin the lamb, cut it
into pieces, and season them with pepper
and salt; lay these in a stewpan, pour in
sufficient stock or gravy to cover them,
and stew very gently until tender, which
will be in about 1½ hour. Just before
serving, thicken the sauce with a little
butter and flour; add the sherry, give
one boil, and pour it over the meat.
Green peas, or stewed mushrooms, may
be strewed over the meat, and will be
found a very great improvement. <i>Time.</i>—1½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 3 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Grass
lamb, from Easter to Michaelmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb, to Carve.</span>—Leg, loin, saddle,
shoulder, are carved as mutton.</p>


<h3>LAMB, Fore-quarter of, to Carve.</h3>

<p>We always think that a good and practised
carver delights in the manipulation
of this joint, for there is a little field for
his judgment and dexterity which does
not always occur. The separation of the
shoulder from the breast is the first point
to be attended to; this is done by passing
the knife round the dotted line, as shown
by the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, so as to
cut through the skin, and then, by
raising with a little force the shoulder,
into which the fork should be firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
fixed, it will come away with just a little
more exercise of the knife. In dividing
the shoulder and breast, the carver
should take care not to cut away too
much of the meat from the latter, as
that would rather spoil its appearance
when the shoulder is removed. The
breast and shoulder being separated,
it is usual to lay a small piece of butter,
and sprinkle a little cayenne, lemon-juice,
and salt between them; and when
this is melted and incorporated with the
meat and gravy, the shoulder may, as
more convenient, be removed into another
dish. The next operation is to separate
the ribs from the brisket, by cutting
through the meat on the line 5 to 6.
The joint is then ready to be served to
the guests; the ribs being carved in the
direction of the lines from 9 to 10, and
the brisket from 7 to 8. The carver
should ask those at the table what parts
they prefer—ribs, brisket, or a piece of
the shoulder.</p>

<h3>LAMB CUTLETS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Loin of lamb, pepper and
salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Trim off the flap
from a fine loin of lamb, and cut it into
cutlets about ¾ inch in thickness. Have
ready a bright clear fire; lay the cutlets
on a gridiron, and broil them of a nice
pale brown, turning them when required.
Season them with pepper and salt; serve
very hot and quickly, and garnish with
crisped parsley, or place them on mashed
potatoes. Asparagus, spinach, or peas
are the favourite accompaniments to
lamb chops. <i>Time.</i>—About 8 or 10

<h3>LAMB, Cutlets and Spinach (an
Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 cutlets, egg and bread-crumbs,
salt and pepper to taste, a little
clarified butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the cutlets
from a neck of lamb, and shape them by

the skin, and scrape the top part of the
bones quite clean. Brush the cutlets
over with egg, sprinkle them with bread-crumbs,
and season with pepper and salt.
Now dip them into clarified butter,
sprinkle over a few more bread-crumbs,
and fry them over a sharp fire, turning
them when required. Lay them before
the fire to drain, and arrange them on a
dish with spinach in the centre, which
should be previously well boiled, drained,
chopped, and seasoned. <i>Time.</i>—About
7 or 8 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per
lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>

<img src="images/illus-175b.jpg" width="288" height="140" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Lamb, a little salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—To obtain the flavour of lamb
in perfection, it should not be long kept;
time to cool is all that it requires; and
though the meat may be somewhat
thready, the juices and flavour will be
infinitely superior to that of lamb that
has been killed 2 or 3 days. Make up
the fire in good time, that it may be
clear and brisk when the joint is put
down. Place it at a sufficient distance
to prevent the fat from burning, and
baste it constantly till the moment of
serving. Lamb should be very <i>thoroughly</i>
done without being dried up, and not
the slightest appearance of red gravy
should be visible, as in roast mutton:
this rule is applicable to all young white
meats. Serve with a little gravy made
in the dripping-pan, the same as for
other roasts, and send to table with it a
tureen of mint sauce, and a fresh salad.
A cut lemon, a small piece of fresh butter,
and a little cayenne, should also be
placed on the table, so that when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
carver separates the shoulder from the
ribs, they may be ready for his use; if,
however, he should not be very expert,
we would recommend that the cook
should divide these joints nicely before
coming to table. <i>Time.</i>—Fore-quarter
of lamb weighing 10 lbs., 1¾ to 2 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Grass
lamb, from Easter to Michaelmas.</p>


<h3>LAMB’S FRY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of lamb’s fry, 3 pints
of water, egg and bread-crumbs, 1 teaspoonful
of chopped parsley, salt and
pepper to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the fry
for ¼ hour in the above proportion of
water, take it out and dry it in a cloth;
grate some bread down finely, mix with
it a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and
a high seasoning of pepper and salt.
Brush the fry lightly over with the yolk
of an egg, sprinkle over the bread-crumbs,
and fry for 5 minutes. Serve very hot
on a napkin in a dish, and garnish with
plenty of crisped parsley. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour
to simmer the fry, 5 minutes to fry it.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for
2 or 3 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from Easter
to Michaelmas.</p>


<h3>LAMB, Hashed, and Broiled Blade-Bone.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of a cold shoulder of
lamb, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz.
of butter, about ½ pint of stock or
gravy, 1 tablespoonful of shalot vinegar,
3 or 4 pickled gherkins. <i>Mode.</i>—Take
the blade-bone from the shoulder,
and cut the meat into collops as neatly
as possible. Season the bone with pepper
and salt, pour a little oiled butter over it,
and place it in the oven to warm through.
Put the stock into a stewpan, add the
ketchup and shalot vinegar, and lay in
the pieces of lamb. Let these heat
gradually through, but do not allow them
to boil. Take the blade-bone out of the
oven, and place it on a gridiron over a
sharp fire to brown. Slice the gherkins,
put them into the hash, and dish it with
the blade-bone in the centre. It may be
garnished with croûtons or sippets of
toasted bread. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether ½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the meat, 4<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Houselamb, from Christmas
to March; grass lamb, from Easter to
Michaelmas.</p>


<h3>LAMB, Boiled Leg of, à la Béchamel.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Leg of lamb, Béchamel

boils up again, draw it to the side of the
fire, and let the water cool a little.
Then stew very gently for about 1¼ hour,
reckoning from the time that the water
begins to simmer. Make some Béchamel,
dish the lamb, pour the sauce over it,
and garnish with tufts of boiled cauliflower
or carrots. When liked, melted
butter may be substituted for the Béchamel:
this is a more simple method, but
not nearly so nice. Send to table with it
some of the sauce in a tureen, and boiled
cauliflowers or spinach, with whichever
vegetable the dish is garnished. <i>Time.</i>—1¼
hour after the water simmers. <i>Average
cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i>

<h3>LANDRAIL, Roast, or Corn-Crake.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/illus-177d.jpg" width="275" height="83" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">LANDRAILS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 or 4 birds, butter, fried
bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Pluck and draw
the birds, wipe them inside and out with
damp cloths, and truss them in the following
manner: Bring the head round
under the wing, and the thighs close to
the sides; pass a skewer through them
and the body, and keep the legs straight.
Roast them before a clear fire, keep
them well basted, and serve on fried
bread-crumbs, with a tureen of brown
gravy. When liked, bread-sauce may
also be sent to table with them. <i>Time.</i>—12
to 20 minutes. <i>Average cost.</i>—Seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
bought. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 4 for a dish.
<i>Seasonable</i> from August 12th to the
middle of September.</p>


<h3>LANDRAIL, to Carve.</h3>

<p>Landrail, being trussed like Snipe, with
the exception of its being drawn, may
be carved in the same manner.</p>


<h3>LARD, to Melt.</h3>

<p>Melt the inner fat of the pig, by putting
it in a stone jar, and placing this in
a saucepan of boiling water, previously
stripping off the skin. Let it simmer
gently over a bright fire, and, as it melts,
pour it carefully from the sediment.
Put it into small jars or bladders for use,
and keep it in a cool place. The flead or
inside fat of the pig, before it is melted,
makes exceedingly light crust, and is
particularly wholesome. It may be preserved
a length of time by salting it
well, and occasionally changing the
brine. When wanted for use, wash and
wipe it, and it will answer for making
into paste as well as fresh lard. <i>Average
cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3>LARDING.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Bacon and larding-needle.
<i>Mode.</i>—Bacon for larding should be
firm and fat, and ought to be cured
without any saltpetre, as this reddens
white meats. Lay it on a table, the
rinds downwards; trim off any rusty
part, and cut it into slices of an equal
thickness. Place the slices one on the
top of another, and cut them evenly into
narrow strips, so arranging it that every
piece of bacon is of the same size. Bacon
for fricandeaux, poultry, and game,
should be about 2 inches in length, and
rather more than one-eighth of an inch
in width. If for larding fillets of beef
or loin of veal, the pieces of bacon must
be thicker. The following recipe of
Soyer is, we think, very explicit; and
any cook, by following the directions
here given, may be able to lard, if not
well, sufficiently for general use:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 286px;">
<img src="images/illus-178.jpg" width="286" height="94" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">BACON FOR LARDING, AND
LARDING-NEEDLE.</div>
</div>

<p>“Have the fricandeau trimmed; lay it,
lengthwise, upon a clean napkin across
your hand, forming a kind of bridge with
your thumb at the part where you are
about to commence; then with the point
of the larding-needle make three distinct
lines across, ½ inch apart; run the
needle into the third line, at the farther
side of the fricandeau, and bring it out
at the first, placing one of the lardoons in
it; draw the needle through, leaving out
¼ inch of the bacon at each line; proceed
thus to the end of the row; then
make another line, ½ inch distant, stick
in another row of lardoons, bringing
them out at the second line, leaving the
ends of the bacon out all the same length;
make the next row again at the same
distance, bringing the ends out between
the lardoons of the first row, proceeding
in this manner until the whole surface
is larded in chequered rows. Everything
else is larded in a similar way;
and, in the case of poultry, hold the
breast over a charcoal fire for one minute,
or dip it into boiling water, in order to
make the flesh firm.”</p>


<h3>LARK PIE (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A few thin slices of beef,
the same of bacon, 9 larks, flour; for
stuffing, 1 teacupful of bread-crumbs,
½ teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1
teaspoonful of minced parsley, 1 egg,
salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of
chopped shalot, ½ pint of weak stock
or water, puff-paste. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a
stuffing of bread-crumbs, minced lemon-peel,
parsley, and the yolk of an egg,
all of which should be well mixed together;
roll the larks in flour, and stuff
them. Line the bottom of a pie-dish
with a few slices of beef and bacon;
over these place the larks, and season
with salt, pepper, minced parsley, and
chopped shalot, in the above proportion.
Pour in the stock or water, cover with
crust, and bake for an hour in a moderate
oven. During the time the pie is
baking, shake it 2 or 3 times, to assist in
thickening the gravy, and serve very hot.
Time.—1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
dozen. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.

fresh butter. <i>Mode.</i>—These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
birds are by many persons esteemed a
great delicacy, and may be either roasted
or broiled. Pick, gut, and clean them;
when they are trussed, brush them over
with the yolk of an egg; sprinkle with
bread-crumbs, and roast them before a
quick fire; baste them continually with
fresh butter, and keep sprinkling with
the bread-crumbs until the birds are well
covered. Dish them on bread-crumbs
fried in clarified butter, and garnish the
dish with slices of lemon. Broiled larks
are also very excellent: they should be
cooked over a clear fire, and would take
about 10 minutes or ¼ hour. <i>Time.</i>—¼
hour to roast; 10 minutes to broil.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—In full season in November.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Larks may also be plainly
roasted, without covering them with egg
and bread-crumbs; they should be dished
on fried crumbs.</p>


<h3>LEEK SOUP.</h3>

two; take out the brains, and put it into
boiling water; add the leeks and seasoning,
and simmer very gently for 4 hours.
Mix smoothly, with cold water, as much
oatmeal as will make the soup tolerably
thick; pour it into the soup; continue

into the butter; stir in the pounded
sugar and very finely-minced lemon-peel,
and when these ingredients are thoroughly
mixed, add the eggs, which
should be previously well whisked, and
the lemon-juice. Beat the mixture well
for a minute or two, then drop it from a
spoon on to a buttered tin, about 2 inches
apart, as the cakes will spread when they
get warm; place the tin in the oven, and
bake the cakes of a pale brown from 15
to 20 minutes. <i>Time.</i>—15 to 20 minutes.

it stand by the side of the fire to dissolve;
boil for a minute or two, stir carefully
into the basin, adding 3 oz. more of
pounded sugar. When cold, stir in the
lemon-juice, which should be carefully
strained, and pour the mixture into a
well-oiled mould, leaving out the lemon-peel,
and set the mould in a pan of cold
water until wanted for table. Use eggs
that have rich-looking yolks; and, should
the weather be very warm, rather a larger
proportion of gelatine must be allowed.

<h3>LEMON JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 lemons, ¾ lb. of lump
sugar, 1 pint of water, 1¼ oz. of isinglass,
¼ pint of sherry. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel 3
of the lemons, pour ½ pint of boiling
water on the rind, and let it infuse for ½
hour; put the sugar, isinglass, and
½ pint of water into a lined saucepan,
and boil these ingredients for 20 minutes;
then put in the strained lemon-juice, the
strained infusion of the rind, and bring
the whole to the point of boiling; skim
well, add the wine, and run the jelly
through a bag; pour it into a mould that
has been wetted or soaked in water; put
it in ice, if convenient, where let it remain
until required for table. Previously to
adding the lemon-juice to the other ingredients,
ascertain that it is very nicely
strained, as, if this is not properly attended
to, it is liable to make the jelly thick and
muddy. As this jelly is very pale, and
almost colourless, it answers very well
for moulding with a jelly of any bright
hue; for instance, half a jelly bright red,
and the other half made of the above,
would have a very good effect. Lemon
jelly may also be made with calf’s-feet
stock, allowing the juice of 3 lemons to
every pint of stock. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>, with the best isinglass,

and boil the peel until tender enough to
mash. Add to the mashed lemon-peel
the apples, which should be pared, cored,
and minced; the chopped suet, currants,
sugar, sliced peel, and spice. Strain
the lemon-juice to these ingredients, stir
the mixture well, and put it in a jar with
a closely-fitting lid. Stir occasionally,
and in a week or 10 days the mincemeat
will be ready for use. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 18 large or 24 small pies.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this about the beginning
of December.</p>


<h3>LEMON-PEEL.</h3>

<p>This contains an essential oil of a very
high flavour and fragrance, and is consequently
esteemed both a wholesome and
agreeable stomachic. It is used, as will
be seen by many recipes in this book, as
an ingredient for flavouring a number of
various dishes. Under the name of
candied lemon-peel, it is cleared of the
pulp and preserved in sugar, when it becomes
an excellent sweetmeat.</p>

salt; to each quart of vinegar, the same
ingredients as in the last recipe. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel
the lemons, slit each one down
3 times, so as not to divide them, and
rub the salt well into the divisions; place
them in a pan, where they must remain
for a week, turning them every other
day; then put them in a Dutch oven
before a clear fire until the salt has
become perfectly dry; then arrange
them in a jar. Pour over sufficient boiling
vinegar to cover them, to which have
been added the ingredients mentioned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the foregoing recipe; tie down closely,

on 2 of the lemons until they have imbibed
all the oil from them, and put it
with the remainder of the sugar into a
jug; add the lemon-juice (but no pips),
and pour over the whole a quart of boiling
water. When the sugar is dissolved,
strain the lemonade through a fine sieve
or piece of muslin, and, when cool, it
will be ready for use. The lemonade will
be much improved by having the white
of an egg beaten up in it; a little sherry
mixed with it, also, makes this beverage
much nicer. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per quart.</p>


<h3>LEMONADE, Nourishing.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of boiling water,
the juice of 4 lemons, the rinds of 2,
½ pint of sherry, 4 eggs, 6 oz. of loaf
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare off the lemon-rind
thinly, put it into a jug with the sugar,
and pour over the boiling water. Let it
cool, then strain it; add the wine, lemon-juice,
and eggs, previously well beaten,
and also strained, and the beverage will
be ready for use. If thought desirable,
the quantity of sherry and water could
be lessened, and milk substituted for
them. To obtain the flavour of the
lemon-rind properly, a few lumps of the
sugar should be rubbed over it, until
some of the yellow is absorbed. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether
1 hour to make it. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to make 2½ pints
of lemonade. <i>Seasonable</i>, at any time.</p>


<h3>LETTUCES.</h3>

<p>These form one of the principal ingredients
to summer salads; they should be
blanched, and be eaten young. They are
seldom served in any other way, but may
be stewed and sent to table in a good
brown gravy flavoured with lemon-juice.
In preparing them for a salad, carefully
wash them free from dirt, pick off all the
decayed and outer leaves, and dry them
thoroughly by shaking them in a cloth.
Cut off the stalks, and either halve or cut
the lettuces into small pieces. The manner
of cutting them up entirely depends
on the salad for which they are intended.
In France, the lettuces are sometimes
merely wiped with a cloth and not
washed, the cooks there declaring that
the act of washing them injuriously
affects the pleasant crispness of the
plant: in this case scrupulous attention
must be paid to each leaf, and the grit
thoroughly wiped away. <i>Average cost</i>,
when cheapest, 1<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
2 lettuces for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from March to the end of
August, but may be had all the year.</p>


<h3>LEVERET, to Dress a.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 leverets, butter, flour.
<i>Mode.</i>—Leverets should be trussed in
the same manner as a hare, but they do
not require stuffing. Roast them before
a clear fire, and keep them well basted
all the time they are cooking. A few
minutes before serving, dredge them
lightly with flour, and froth them nicely.
Serve with plain gravy in the dish, and
send to table red-currant jelly with them.
<i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, in full
season, 4<i>s.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from May to August,
but cheapest in July and August.</p>


<h3>LIAISON OF EGGS, for Thickening
Sauces.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The yolks of 3 eggs,
8 tablespoonfuls of milk or cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<i>Mode.</i>—Beat up the yolks of the eggs,
to which add the milk, and strain the
whole through a hair-sieve. When the
liaison is being added to the sauce it is
intended to thicken, care must be exercised
to keep stirring it during the whole
time, or, otherwise, the eggs will curdle.
It should only just simmer, but not boil.</p>


<h3>LIQUEUR JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of lump sugar, 2 oz.
of isinglass, 1½ pint of water, the juice of
2 lemons, ¼ pint of liqueur. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the sugar, with 1 pint of the water,
into a stewpan, and boil them gently by
the side of the fire until there is no scum
remaining, which must be carefully removed
as fast as it rises. Boil the isinglass
with the other ½ pint of water, and
skim it carefully in the same manner.
Strain the lemon-juice, and add it, with
the clarified isinglass, to the syrup; put
in the liqueur, and bring the whole to
the boiling-point. Let the saucepan
remain covered by the side of the fire
for a few minutes; then pour the jelly
through a bag, put it into a mould, and
set the mould in ice until required for
table. Dip the mould in hot water, wipe
the outside, loosen the jelly by passing a
knife round the edges, and turn it out
carefully on a dish. Noyeau, Maraschino,
Curaçoa, brandy, or any kind of liqueur,
answers for this jelly; and, when made
with isinglass, liqueur jellies are usually
prepared as directed above. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes to boil the sugar and water.
<i>Average cost</i>, with the best isinglass,
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill a quart mould.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<h3>LIVER AND LEMON SAUCE,
for Poultry.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The liver of a fowl, one
lemon, salt to taste, ½ pint of melted
butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the liver, and let
it boil for a few minutes; peel the lemon
very thin, remove the white part and
pips, and cut it into very small dice;
mince the liver and a small quantity of
the lemon-rind very fine; add these ingredients
to ½ pint of smoothly-made
melted butter; season with a little salt,
put in the cut lemon, heat it gradually,
but do not allow it to boil, lest the butter
should oil. <i>Time.</i>—1 minute to simmer.
<i>Sufficient</i> to serve with a pair of small
fowls.</p>


<h3>LIVER AND PARSLEY SAUCE,
for Poultry.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The liver of a fowl, one
tablespoonful of minced parsley, ½ pint
of melted butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash and
score the liver, boil it for a few minutes,
and mince it very fine; blanch or scald
a small bunch of parsley, of which there
should be sufficient when chopped to fill
a tablespoon; add this with the minced
liver, to ½ pint of smoothly-made melted
butter; let it just boil; when serve.
<i>Time.</i>—1 minute to simmer. <i>Sufficient</i>
for a pair of small fowls.</p>


<h3>LOBSTERS, to Boil.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of salt to each gallon
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Buy the lobsters alive,
and choose those that are heavy and full
of motion, which is an indication of their
freshness. When the shell is incrusted,
it is a sign they are old: medium-sized
lobsters are the best. Have ready a
stewpan of boiling water, salted in the
above proportion; put in the lobster, and
keep it boiling quickly from 20 minutes
to ¾ hour, according to its size, and do
not forget to skim well. If it boils too
long, the meat becomes thready, and if
not done enough, the spawn is not red:
this must be obviated by great attention.
Rub the shell over with a little butter or
sweet oil, which wipe off again. <i>Time.</i>—Small
lobster, 20 minutes to ½ hour;
large ditto, ½ to ¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
medium size, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year, but best from March to
October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Choose Lobsters.</span>—This shellfish,
if it has been cooked alive, as it
ought to have been, will have a stiffness
in the tail, which, if gently raised, will
return with a spring. Care, however,
must be taken in thus proving it; for if
the tail is pulled straight out, it will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
return; when the fish might be pronounced
inferior, which, in reality, may
not be the case. In order to be good,
lobsters should be weighty for their
bulk; if light, they will be watery; and
those of the medium size, are always the
best. Small-sized lobsters are cheapest,
and answer very well for sauce. In boiling
lobsters, the appearance of the shell
will be much improved by rubbing over
it a little butter or salad-oil on being
immediately taken from the pot.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER CURRY (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lobster, 2 onions, 1 oz.
butter, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder,
½ pint of medium stock, the juice of ½
lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick the meat from the
shell, and cut into nice square pieces;
fry the onions of a pale brown in the
butter, stir in the curry-powder and
stock, and simmer till it thickens, when
put in the lobster; stew the whole slowly
for ½ hour, stirring occasionally; and
just before sending to table, put in the
lemon-juice. Serve boiled rice with it,
the same as for other curries. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER CUTLETS (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 large hen lobster, 1 oz.
fresh butter, ½ saltspoonful of salt,
pounded mace, grated nutmeg, cayenne
and white pepper to taste, egg, and
bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick the meat
from the shell, and pound it in a mortar
with the butter, and gradually add the
mace and seasoning, well mixing the
ingredients; beat all to a smooth paste,
and add a little of the spawn; divide
the mixture into pieces of an equal size,
and shape them like cutlets. They
should not be very thick. Brush them
over with egg, and sprinkle with bread-crumbs,
and stick a short piece of the
small claw in the top of each; fry them
of a nice brown in boiling lard, and drain
them before the fire, on a sieve reversed;
arrange them nicely on a dish, and pour
béchamel in the middle, but not over the
cutlets. <i>Time.</i>—About 8 minutes after
the cutlets are made. <i>Average cost</i> for
this dish, 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> all the year.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.</p>


<h3>LOBSTERS, to Dress.</h3>

<p>When the lobster is boiled, rub it over
with a little salad-oil, which wipe off
again; separate the body from the tail,
break off the great claws, and crack them
at the joints, without injuring the meat;
split the tail in halves, and arrange all
neatly in a dish, with the body upright
in the middle, and garnish with parsley.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER, Hot.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lobster, 2 oz. of butter,
grated nutmeg; salt, pepper, and pounded
mace, to taste; broad crumbs, 2 eggs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Pound the meat of the lobster to
a smooth paste with the butter and seasoning,
and add a few bread-crumbs.
Beat the eggs, and make the whole mixture
into the form of a lobster; pound
the spawn, and sprinkle over it. Bake
¼ hour, and just before serving, lay over
it the tail and body shell, with the small
claws underneath, to resemble a lobster.
<i>Time.</i>—¼ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4
or 5 persons.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER PATTIES (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Minced lobster, 4 tablespoonfuls
of béchamel, 6 drops of anchovy
sauce, lemon-juice, cayenne to taste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Line the patty-pans with puff-paste,
and put into each a small piece of
bread; cover with paste, brush over with
egg, and bake of a light colour. Take
as much lobster as is required, mince the
meat very fine, and add the above ingredients;
stir it over the fire for 5 minutes;
remove the lids of the patty-cases, take
out the bread, fill with the mixture, and
replace the covers. <i>Seasonably</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER, Potted.</h3>

it up. Put some butter at the bottom of
a dish, lay in the lobster as evenly as
possible, with the bay-leaves and seasoning
between. Cover with butter, and
bake for ¾ hour in a gentle oven. When
done, drain the whole on a sieve, and
lay the pieces in potting-jars, with the
seasoning about them. When cold, pour
over it clarified butter, and, if very
highly seasoned, it will keep some time.
<i>Time.</i>—¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i> for this
quantity, 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Potted lobster may be used
cold, or as a <i>fricassee</i> with cream sauce.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER (à la Mode Française).</h3>

of white stock, 2 tablespoonfuls of
cream, pounded mace, and cayenne to
taste; bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick the
meat from the shell, and cut it up into
small square pieces; put the stock,
cream, and seasoning into a stewpan,
add the lobster, and let it simmer gently
for 6 minutes. Serve it in the shell,
which must be nicely cleaned, and have
a border of puff-paste; cover it with
bread-crumbs, place small pieces of butter
over, and brown before the fire, or with
a salamander. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER SALAD.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 hen lobster, lettuces,
endive, small salad (whatever is in season),
a little chopped beetroot, 2 hard-boiled
eggs, a few slices of cucumber.
For dressing, 4 tablespoonfuls of oil, 2
do. of vinegar, 1 teaspoonful of made
mustard, the yolks of 2 eggs; cayenne
and salt to taste; ¼ teaspoonful of
anchovy sauce. These ingredients should
be mixed perfectly smooth, and form a
creamy-looking sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
the salad, and thoroughly dry it by
shaking it in a cloth. Cut up the lettuces
and endive, pour the dressing on
them, and lightly throw in the small
salad. Mix all well together with the
pickings from the body of the lobster;
pick the meat from the shell, cut it up
into nice square pieces, put half in the
salad, the other half reserve for garnishing.
Separate the yolks from the
whites of 2 hard-boiled eggs; chop the
whites very fine, and rub the yolks
through a sieve, and afterwards the coral
from the inside. Arrange the salad
lightly on a glass dish, and garnish, first
with a row of sliced cucumber, then with
the pieces of lobster, the yolks and
whites of the eggs, coral, and beetroot
placed alternately, and arranged in
small separate bunches, so that the colours
contrast nicely. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from April to October; may be had all
the year, but salad is scarce and expensive
in winter.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A few crayfish make a pretty
garnishing to lobster salad.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER SAUCE, to serve with
Turbot, Salmon, Brill, &amp;c. (very
Good.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 middling-sized hen
lobster, ¾ pint of melted butter, 1 tablespoonful
of anchovy sauce, ½ oz. of
butter, salt and cayenne to taste, a little
pounded mace when liked, 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls
of cream. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose a
hen lobster, as this is indispensable, in
order to render this sauce as good as it
ought to be. Pick the meat from the
shells, and cut it into small square
pieces; put the spawn, which will be
found under the tail of the lobster, into
a mortar with ½ oz. of butter, and pound
it quite smooth; rub it through a hair-sieve,
and cover up till wanted. Make
¾ pint of melted butter; put in all the
ingredients except the lobster-meat, and
well mix the sauce before the lobster is
added to it, as it should retain its square
form, and not come to table shredded
and ragged. Put in the meat, let it get
thoroughly hot, but do not allow it to
boil, as the colour would immediately
be spoiled; for it must be remembered
that this sauce should always have a
bright red appearance. If it is intended
to be served with turbot or brill, a little
of the spawn (dried and rubbed through
a sieve without butter) should be saved
to garnish with; but as the goodness,
flavour, and appearance of the sauce so
much depend on having a proper quantity
of spawn, the less used for garnishing
the better. <i>Time.</i>—1 minute to simmer.
<i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time. <i>Sufficient</i> to serve
with a small turbot, a brill, or salmon for
6 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Melted butter made with milk,
will be found to answer very well for
lobster sauce, as by employing it a nice
white colour will be obtained. Less
quantity than the above may be made
by using a very small lobster, to which
add only ½ pint of melted butter, and
season as above. Where economy is
desired, the cream may be dispensed
with, and the remains of a cold lobster
left from table, may, with a little care,
be converted into a very good sauce.</p>


<h3>LOBSTER SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 large lobsters, or 6
small ones; the crumb of a French roll,
2 anchovies, 1 onion, 1 small bunch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
sweet herbs, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 2 oz.
of butter, a little nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful
of flour, 1 pint of cream, 1 pint of milk;
forcemeat balls, mace, salt, and pepper
to taste, bread-crumbs, 1 egg, 2 quarts
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick the meat from
the lobsters, and beat the fins, chine,
and small claws in a mortar, previously
taking away the brown fin and the bag
in the head. Put it in a stewpan, with
the crumb of the roll, anchovies, onions,
herbs, lemon-peel, and the water; simmer
gently till all the goodness is extracted,
and strain it off. Pound the
spawn in a mortar, with the butter,
nutmeg, and flour, and mix with it the
cream and milk. Give one boil up, at
the same time adding the tails cut in
pieces. Make the forcemeat balls with
the remainder of the lobster, seasoned
with mace, pepper, and salt, adding a
little flour, and a few bread-crumbs;
moisten them with the egg, heat them in
the soup, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours, or
rather more. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
quart. <i>Seasonable</i> from April to October.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>


<h3>LUNCHEONS.</h3>

<p>The remains of cold joints, nicely garnished,
a few sweets, or a little hashed
meat, poultry or game, are the usual
articles placed on the table for luncheon,
with bread, and cheese, biscuits, butter,
&amp;c. If a substantial meal is desired,
rump-steaks or mutton chops may be
served, as also veal cutlets, kidneys, or
any dish of that kind. In families where
there is a nursery, the mistress of the
house often partakes of the meal with
the children, and makes it her luncheon.
In the summer, a few dishes of fresh
fruit should be added to the luncheon, or,
instead of this, a compôte of fruit or fruit
tart, or pudding.</p>


<h3>MACARONI, as usually served
with the CHEESE COURSE.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of pipe macaroni,
1 lb. of butter, 6 oz. of Parmesan or
Cheshire cheese, pepper and salt to taste,
1 pint of milk, 2 pints of water, bread-crumbs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk and water
into a saucepan with sufficient salt to
flavour it; place it on the fire, and, when
it boils quickly, drop in the macaroni.
Keep the water boiling until it is quite
tender; drain the macaroni, and put it
into a deep dish. Have ready the grated
cheese, either Parmesan or Cheshire;
sprinkle it amongst the macaroni and
some of the butter cut into small pieces,
reserving some of the cheese for the top
layer. Season with a little pepper, and
cover the top layer of cheese with some
very fine bread-crumbs. Warm, without
oiling, the remainder of the butter, and
pour it gently over the bread-crumbs,
Place the dish before a bright fire to
brown the crumbs; turn it once or twice,
that it may be equally coloured, and
serve very hot. The top of the macaroni
may be browned with a salamander,
which is even better than placing it
before the fire, as the process is more
expeditious; but it should never be
browned in the oven, as the butter would
oil, and so impart a very disagreeable
flavour to the dish. In boiling the macaroni,
let it be perfectly tender but firm,
no part beginning to melt, and the form
entirely preserved. It may be boiled in
plain-water, with a little salt instead of
using milk, but should then have a small
piece of butter mixed with it. <i>Time.</i>—1
to 1½ hours to boil the macaroni,
5 minutes to brown it before the fire.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6
or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Riband macaroni may be dressed
in the same manner, but does not require
boiling so long a time.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of pipe or riband
macaroni, ½ pint of milk, ½ pint of veal
or beef gravy, the yolks of 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls
of cream, 3 oz. of grated Parmesan
or Cheshire cheese, 1 oz. of butter.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the macaroni, and boil it
in the gravy and milk until quite tender,
without being broken. Drain it, and
put it into rather a deep dish. Beat the
yolks of the eggs with the cream and
2 tablespoonfuls of the liquor the macaroni
was boiled in; make this sufficiently
hot to thicken, but do not allow it to
boil; pour it over the macaroni, over
which sprinkle the grated cheese and the
butter broken into small pieces; brown
with a salamander, or before the fire, and
serve. <i>Time.</i>—1 to 1½ hour to boil the
macaroni, 5 minutes to thicken the eggs
and cream, 5 minutes to brown. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4 persons,
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of pipe macaroni,
½ pint of brown gravy No. 436, 6 oz. of
grated Parmesan cheese. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
the macaroni, and boil it in salt and
water until quite tender; drain it, and
put it into rather a deep dish. Have
ready a pint of good brown gravy, pour
it hot over the macaroni, and send it to
table with grated Parmesan served on a
separate dish. When the flavour is liked,
a little pounded mace may be added to
the water in which the macaroni is boiled;
but this must always be sparingly added,
as it will impart a very strong flavour.
<i>Time.</i>—1 to 1½ hour to boil the macaroni.
<i>Average cost</i>, with the gravy and cheese,
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>MACARONI, Sweet Pudding.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2½ oz. of macaroni, 2 pints,
of milk, the rind of ½ lemon, 3 eggs, sugar
and grated nutmeg to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls
of brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the macaroni,
with a pint of the milk, into a
saucepan with the lemon-peel, and let it
simmer gently until the macaroni is
tender: then put it into a pie-dish without
the peel; mix the other pint of milk
with the eggs; stir these well together,
adding the sugar and brandy, and pour
the mixture over the macaroni. Grate a
little nutmeg over the top, and bake in a
moderate oven for ½ hour. To make this
pudding look nice, a paste should be laid
round the edges of the dish, and, for
variety, a layer of preserve or marmalade
may be placed on the macaroni: in this
case, omit the brandy. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour
to simmer the macaroni; ½ hour to bake
the pudding. <i>Average cost</i>, 11<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>MACARONI SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 oz. of macaroni, a piece
of butter the size of a walnut, salt to
taste, 2 quarts of clear stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Throw
the macaroni and butter into boiling
water, with a pinch of salt, and
simmer for ½ an hour. When it is tender,
drain and cut it into thin rings or lengths,
and drop it into the boiling stock. Stew
gently for 15 minutes, and serve grated
Parmesan cheese with it. <i>Time.</i>—¾ to 1
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>


<h3>MACARONI, a Sweet Dish of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of macaroni, 1½ pint
of milk, the rind of ½ lemon, 3 oz. of lump
sugar, ¾ pint of custard. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the milk into a saucepan, with the lemon-peel
and sugar; bring it to the boiling-point,
drop in the macaroni, and let it
gradually swell over a gentle fire, but do
not allow the pipes to break. The form
should be entirely preserved; and, though
tender, should be firm, and not soft, with
no part beginning to melt. Should the
milk dry away before the macaroni is
sufficiently swelled, add a little more.
Make a custard, place the macaroni on a
dish, and pour the custard over the hot
macaroni; grate over it a little nutmeg,
and, when cold, garnish the dish with
slices of candied citron. <i>Time.</i>—From
40 to 50 minutes to swell the macaroni.
<i>Average cost</i>, with the custard, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>MACAROONS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of sweet almonds,
½ lb. of sifted loaf sugar, the whites
of three eggs, wafer paper. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch,
skin and dry the almonds, and
pound them well with a little orange
flower or plain water, then add the sifted
sugar and the whites of the eggs, which
should be beaten to a stiff froth, and mix
all the ingredients well together. When
the paste looks soft, drop it at equal distances
from a biscuit syringe on to sheets
of wafer paper: put a strip of almond on
the top of each; strew some syrup over,
and bake the macaroons in rather a slow
oven, of a light brown colour. When
hard and set, they are done. They must
not be allowed to get very brown, as that
would spoil their appearance. If the
cakes when baked, appear heavy, add a
little more white of egg, which should
be well whisked up before it is added
to the other ingredients. <i>Time.</i>—From
15 to 20 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
per lb.</p>


<h3>MACKEREL.</h3>

<p>In choosing this fish, purchasers should,
to a great extent, be regulated by the
brightness of its appearance. If it has
a transparent, silvery hue, the flesh is
good; but if it be red about the head, it
is stale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>


<h3>MACKEREL, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>— 4 middling-sized mackerel,
a nice delicate forcemeat, 3 oz. of
butter; pepper and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Clean
the fish, take out the roes, and
fill up with forcemeat, and sew up the
slit. Flour, and put them in a dish,
heads and tails alternately, with the
roes; and, between each layer, put some
little pieces of butter, and pepper and
salt. Bake for ½ an hour, and either
serve with plain melted butter or a <i>maître
d’hôtel</i> sauce. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i> for this quantity, 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
from April to July. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Baked mackerel may be dressed
in the same way as baked herrings, and
may also be stewed in wine.</p>


<h3>MACKEREL, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of salt to each gallon
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse the inside
of the fish thoroughly, and lay it in the
kettle with sufficient water to cover it
with salt as above; bring it gradually to
boil, skim well, and simmer gently till
done; dish them on a hot napkin, heads
and tails alternately, and garnish with
fennel. Fennel sauce and plain melted
butter are the usual accompaniments to
boiled mackerel; but caper or anchovy
sauce is sometimes served with it. <i>Time.</i>—After
the water boils, 10 minutes; for
large mackerel, allow more time. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from April
to July.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When variety is desired, fillet
the mackerel, boil it, and pour over parsley
and butter; send some of this,
besides, in a tureen.</p>


<h3>MACKEREL, Broiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pepper and salt to taste,
a small quantity of oil. <i>Mode.</i>—Mackerel
should never be washed when intended
to be broiled, but merely wiped very
clean and dry, after taking out the gills
and insides. Open the back, and put in
a little pepper, salt, and oil; broil it
over a clear fire, turn it over on both
sides, and also on the back. When
sufficiently cooked, the flesh can be
detached from the bone, which will be in
about 10 minutes for a small mackerel.
Chop a little parsley, work it up in the
butter with pepper and salt to taste, and
a squeeze of lemon-juice, and put it in
the back. Serve before the butter is
quite melted, with a <i>maître d’hôtel</i> sauce
in a tureen. <i>Time.</i>—Small mackerel
10 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, from 4<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> from April to July.</p>


<h3>MACKEREL, Fillets of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 large mackerel, 1 oz.
butter, 1 small bunch of chopped herbs,
3 tablespoonfuls of medium stock, 3 tablespoonfuls
of béchamel; salt, cayenne,
and lemon-juice to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Clean
the fish, and fillet it; scald the herbs,
chop them fine, and put them with the
butter and stock into a stewpan. Lay in
the mackerel, and simmer very gently
for 10 minutes; take them out, and put
them on a hot dish. Dredge in a little
flour, add the other ingredients, give
one boil, and pour it over the mackerel.
<i>Time.</i>—20 minutes. <i>Average cost</i> for
this quantity, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from
April to July. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Fillets of mackerel may be
covered with egg and bread-crumbs, and
fried of a nice brown. Serve with <i>maître
d’hôtel</i> sauce and plain melted butter.</p>


<h3>MACKEREL, Pickled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 peppercorns, 2 bay-leaves,
½ pint of vinegar, 4 mackerel.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil the mackerel, and lay them
in a dish; take half the liquor they were
boiled in; add as much vinegar, peppercorns,
and bay-leaves; boil for 10 minutes,
and when cold, pour over the fish. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>MACKEREL, Potted.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Mackerel, a blade of
mace, cayenne, salt, and 2 oz. or more
butter, according to the quantity of
mackerel. <i>Mode.</i>—Any remains of cooked
mackerel may be potted as follows; pick
it well from the bones, break it into very
small pieces, and put into a stewpan with
the butter, pounded mace, and other ingredients;
warm it thoroughly, but do
not let it boil; press it into potting pots
and pour clarified butter over it.</p>


<h3>MAIGRE SOUP (i.e., Soup without
Meat).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. butter, 6 onions
sliced, 4 heads of celery, 2 lettuces, a
small bunch of parsley, 2 handfuls of
spinach, 3 pieces of bread-crust, 2 blades
of mace, salt and pepper to taste, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
yolks of 2 eggs, 3 teaspoonfuls of vinegar,
2 quarts of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Melt the
butter in a stewpan, and put in the onions
to stew gently for 3 or 4 minutes; then
add the celery, spinach, lettuces, and
parsley, cut small. Stir the ingredients
well for 10 minutes. Now put in the
water, bread, seasoning, and mace. Boil
gently for 1½ hour, and, at the moment
of serving, beat in the yolks of the eggs
and the vinegar, but do not let it boil, or
the eggs will curdle. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>


<h3>MAIZE, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The ears of young and
green Indian wheat; to every ½ gallon
of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—This vegetable, which
makes one of the most delicious dishes,
brought to table, is unfortunately very
rarely seen in Britain; and we wonder
that, in the gardens of the wealthy, it is
not invariably cultivated. Our sun, it is
true, possesses hardly power sufficient
to ripen maize; but, with well-prepared
ground, and in a favourable position, it
might be sufficiently advanced by the
beginning of autumn to serve as a vegetable.
The outside sheath being taken
off and the waving fibres removed, let
the ears be placed in boiling water,
where they should remain for about 25
minutes (a longer time may be necessary
for larger ears than ordinary); and,
when sufficiently boiled and well drained,
they may be sent to table whole, and
with a piece of toast underneath them.

<h3>MARROW-BONES, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Bones, a small piece of

there is sufficient to cover them. Boil
them for 2 hours, remove the cloth and
paste, and serve them upright on a napkin
with dry toast. Many persons clear
the marrow from the bones after they
are cooked, spread it over a slice of toast
and add a seasoning of pepper: when
served in this manner, it must be very
expeditiously sent to table, as it so soon
gets cold. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours. <i>Seasonable</i>

1 teaspoonful of minced onion, 1 teaspoonful
of minced parsley, salt and
grated nutmeg to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat
the marrow and butter together to a
cream; well whisk the eggs, and add
these to the other ingredients. When
they are well stirred, put in the rolls,
which should previously be well soaked
in boiling milk, strained, and beaten up
with a fork. Add the remaining ingredients,
omitting the minced onion where
the flavour is very much disliked, and
form the mixture into small round dumplings.
Drop these into boiling broth,
and let them simmer for about 20 minutes
or ½ hour. They may be served in soup,
with roast meat, or with salad, as in
Germany, where they are more frequently
sent to table than in this country. They
are very good. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to
½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
7 or 8 dumplings. <i>Seasonable</i> at any

<i>Mode.</i>—Make the milk boiling, pour it
hot on to the bread-crumbs, and let these
remain covered for about ½ hour; shred
the marrow, beat up the eggs, and mix
these with the bread-crumbs; add the
remaining ingredients, beat the mixture
well, and either put it into a buttered
mould and boil it for 2½ hours, or put it
into a pie-dish edged with puff-paste, and
bake for rather more than ¾ hour. Before
sending it to table, sift a little pounded
sugar over, after being turned out of the
mould or basin. <i>Time.</i>—2½ hours to
boil, ¾ hour to bake. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>

it should be made in a very cool place,
or, if ice is at hand, it should be mixed
over it. When the vinegar and oil are
well incorporated with the eggs, add the
stock and cream, stirring all the time,
and it will then be ready for use.</p>

<p>For a fish Mayonnaise, this sauce may
be coloured with lobster-spawn, pounded;
and for poultry or meat, where variety is
desired, a little parsley-juice may be
used to add to its appearance. Cucumber,
tarragon, or any other flavoured
vinegar, may be substituted for plain,
where they are liked. <i>Average cost</i>, for
this quantity, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a small
salad.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—In mixing the oil and vinegar
with the eggs, put in first a few drops of
oil, and then a few drops of vinegar,
never adding a large quantity of either
at one time. By this means, you can be
more certain of the sauce not curdling.
Patience and practice, let us add, are
two essentials for making this sauce
good.</p>


<h3>MELONS.</h3>

<p>This fruit is rarely preserved or cooked
in any way, but is sent whole to table
on a dish garnished with leaves or
flowers, as fancy dictates. A border of
any other kind of small fruit, arranged
round the melon, has a pretty effect,
the colour of the former contrasting
nicely with the melon. Plenty of
pounded sugar should be served with it;
and the fruit should be cut lengthwise,
in moderate-sized slices. In America, it
is frequently eaten with pepper and salt.
<i>Average cost.</i>—English, in full season,
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> each; when scarce, 10<i>s.</i> to
15<i>s.</i>; <i>seasonable</i>, June to August. French,
2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each; <i>seasonable</i>, June and
July. Dutch, 9<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> each; <i>seasonable</i>,
July and August.</p>


<h3>MERINGUES.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 230px;">
<img src="images/illus-197.jpg" width="230" height="231" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">MERINGUES.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of pounded sugar,
the whites of 4 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Whisk
the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and, with a wooden spoon, stir in <i>quickly</i>
the pounded sugar; and have some
boards thick enough to put in the oven
to prevent the bottom of the meringues
from acquiring too much colour. Cut
some strips of paper about 2 inches wide;
place this paper on the board, and drop
a tablespoonful at a time of the mixture
on the paper, taking care to let all the
meringues be the same size. In dropping
it from the spoon, give the mixture the
form of an egg, and keep the meringues
about 2 inches apart from each other on
the paper. Strew over them some sifted
sugar, and bake in a moderate oven for
½ hour. As soon as they begin to colour,
remove them from the oven; take each
slip of paper by the two ends, and turn
it gently on the table, and, with a small
spoon, take out the soft part of each
meringue. Spread some clean paper on
the board, turn the meringues upside
down, and put them into the oven to
harden and brown on the other side.
When required for table, fill them with
whipped cream, flavoured with liqueur or
vanilla, and sweetened with pounded
sugar. Join two of the meringues together,
and pile them high in the dish, as
shown in the annexed drawing. To vary
their appearance, finely-chopped almonds
or currants may be strewn over them
before the sugar is sprinkled over; and
they may be garnished with any bright-coloured
preserve. Great expedition is
necessary in making this sweet dish; as,
if the meringues are not put into the
oven as soon as the sugar and eggs are
mixed, the former melts, and the mixture
would run on the paper, instead of
keeping its egg-shape. The sweeter the
meringues are made, the crisper will they
be; but, if there is not sufficient sugar
mixed with them, they will most likely
be tough. They are sometimes coloured
with cochineal; and, if kept well covered
in a dry place, will remain good for a
month or six weeks. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
about ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, with the
cream and flavouring, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to
make 2 dozen meringues. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>MILK.</h3>

<p>Milk, when of good quality, is of an
opaque white colour: the cream always
comes to the top; the well-known milky
odour is strong; it will boil without
altering its appearance in these respects;
the little bladders which arise on the
surface will renew themselves if broken
by the spoon. To boil milk is, in fact,
the simplest way of testing its quality.
The commonest adulterations of milk
are not of a hurtful character. It is a
good deal thinned with water, and sometimes
thickened with a little starch, or
coloured with yolk of egg, or even
saffron; but these processes have nothing
murderous in them.</p>


<h3>MILK AND CREAM, to keep, in
hot Weather.</h3>

<p>When the weather is very warm, and
it is very difficult to prevent milk from
turning sour and spoiling the cream, it
should be scalded, and it will then remain
good for a few hours. It must on
no account be allowed to boil, or there
will be a skin instead of a cream upon
the milk; and the slower the process the
safer will it be. A very good plan to
scald milk, is to put the pan that contains
it into a saucepan or wide kettle of
boiling water. When the surface looks
thick, the milk is sufficiently scalded,
and it should then be put away in a cool
place in the same vessel that it was
scalded in. Cream may be kept for 24
hours, if scalded without sugar; and by
the addition of the latter ingredient, it
will remain good double the time, if
kept in a cool place. All pans, jugs,
and vessels intended for milk, should be
kept beautifully clean, and well scalded
before the milk is put in, as any negligence
in this respect may cause large
quantities of it to be spoiled; and milk
should never be kept in vessels of zinc or
copper. Milk may be preserved good in
hot weather, for a few hours, by placing
the jug which contains it in ice, or very
cold water; or a pinch of bicarbonate of
soda may be introduced into the liquid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>


<h3>MILK AND CREAM, Separation
of.</h3>

<p>If it be desired that the milk should
be freed entirely from cream, it should
be poured into a very shallow broad pan
or dish, not more than 1½ inch deep, as
cream cannot rise through a great depth
of milk. In cold and wet weather, milk
is not so rich as it is in summer and
warm weather, and the morning’s milk
is always richer than the evening’s. The
last-drawn milk of each milking, at all
times and seasons, is richer than the
first-drawn, and on that account should
be set apart for cream. Milk should be
shaken as little as possible when carried
from the cow to the dairy, and should be
poured into the pans very gently. Persons
not keeping cows, may always have
a little cream, provided the milk they
purchase be pure and unadulterated.
As soon as it comes in, it should be
poured into very shallow open pie-dishes,
and set by in a very cool place, and in 7
or 8 hours a nice cream should have risen
to the surface.</p>


<h3>MILK AND CREAM, Substitute
for, in Tea and Coffee.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 new laid egg to every
large breakfast-cupful of tea or coffee.
<i>Mode.</i>—Beat up the whole of the egg in
a basin, put it into a cup, and pour over
it the tea or coffee quite hot, stirring all
the time to prevent the egg from curdling.
In point of nourishment, both tea
and coffee are much improved by this
addition. <i>Sufficient.</i>—1 egg to every
large breakfast-cupful of tea or coffee.</p>


<h3>MILK SOUP (a nice Dish for
Children).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 quarts of milk, 1 saltspoonful
of salt, 1 teaspoonful of powdered
cinnamon, 3 teaspoonfuls of
pounded sugar, or more if liked, 4 thin
slices of bread, the yolks of 6 eggs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil the milk with the salt,
cinnamon, and sugar; lay the bread in
a deep dish, pour over it a little of the
milk, and keep it hot over a stove, without
burning. Beat up the yolks of the
eggs, add them to the milk, and stir it
over the fire till it thickens. Do not let
it curdle. Pour it upon the bread, and
serve. <i>Time.</i>—¾ of an hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i> all the
year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 10 children.</p>


<h3>MINCE PIES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Good puff-paste, mincemeat.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make some good puff-paste
by recipe; roll it out to the thickness
of about
¼ inch, and
line  some
good-sized
patty-pans
with it; fill
them with
mincemeat,
cover with the paste, and cut it off all
round close to the edge of the tin. Put
the pies into a brisk oven, to draw the
paste up, and bake for 25 minutes, or
longer, should the pies be very large;
brush them over with the white of an
egg, beaten with the blade of a knife to a
stiff froth; sprinkle over pounded sugar,
and put them into the oven for a minute
or two, to dry the egg; dish the pies on
a white d’oyley, and serve hot. They
may be merely sprinkled with pounded
sugar instead of being glazed, when that
mode is preferred. To re-warm them,
put the pies on the patty-pans, and let
them remain in the oven for 10 minutes
or ¼ hour, and they will be almost as
good as if freshly made. <i>Time.</i>—25 to
30 minutes; 10 minutes to re-warm them.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>—½ lb.
of paste for 4 pies. <i>Seasonable</i> at Christmas
time.</p>

<h3>MINCEMEAT.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of raisins, 3 lbs. of
currants, 1½ lb. of lean beef, 3 lbs. of
beef suet, 2 lbs. of moist sugar, 2 oz.
of citron, 2 oz. of candied lemon-peel,
2 oz. of candied orange-peel, 1 large
nutmeg, 1 pottle of apples, the rind of
2 lemons, the juice of 1, ½ pint of brandy.
<i>Mode.</i>—Stone and <i>cut</i> the raisins once or
twice across, but do not chop them;
wash, dry, and pick the currants free
from stalks and grit, and mince the beef
and suet, taking care that the latter
is chopped very fine; slice the citron
and candied peel, grate the nutmeg, and
pare, core, and mince the apples; mince
the lemon-peel, strain the juice, and
when all the ingredients are thus prepared,
mix them well together, adding
the brandy when the other things are
well blended; press the whole into a jar,
carefully exclude the air, and the mincemeat
will be ready for use in a fortnight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
If an additional quantity of spice be preferred,
add ½ teaspoonful of pounded
mace, and the same of pounded allspice.
We, however, prefer the mincemeat
without the latter ingredients, and can
vouch for its excellence. <i>Average cost</i>
for this quantity, 8<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this about the beginning of December.</p>


<h3>MINCEMEAT, Excellent.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 large lemons, 3 large
apples, 1 lb. of stoned raisins, 1 lb. of
currants, 1 lb. of suet, 2 lbs. of moist
sugar, 1 oz. of sliced candied citron, 1 oz.
of sliced candied orange-peel, and the
same quantity of lemon-peel, 1 teacupful
of brandy, 2 tablespoonfuls of orange
marmalade. <i>Mode.</i>—Grate the rinds of
the lemons; squeeze out the juice, strain
it, and boil the remainder of the lemons
until tender enough to pulp or chop very
finely. Then add to this pulp the apples,
which should be baked, and their skins
and cores removed; put in the remaining
ingredients one by one, and, as they are
added, mix everything very thoroughly
together. Put the mincemeat into a
stone jar with a closely-fitting lid, and in
a fortnight it will be ready for use.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—This should be made the
first or second week in December.</p>


<h3>MINT SAUCE, to serve with Roast
Lamb.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 dessertspoonfuls of
chopped mint, 2 dessertspoonfuls of
pounded white sugar, ¼ pint of vinegar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the mint, which should be
young and fresh-gathered, free from
grit; pick the leaves from the stalks,
mince them very fine, and put them into
a tureen; add the sugar and vinegar, and
stir till the former is dissolved. This
sauce is better by being made 2 or 3
hours before wanted for table, as the
vinegar then becomes impregnated with
the flavour of the mint. By many persons,
the above proportion of sugar would
not be considered sufficient; but as
tastes vary, we have given the quantity
which we have found to suit the general
palate. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to
serve with a middling-size joint of lamb.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Where green mint is scarce and
not obtainable, mint vinegar may be substituted
for it, and will be found very
acceptable in early spring.</p>


<h3>MINT VINEGAR.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Vinegar, mint. <i>Mode.</i>—Procure
some nice fresh mint, pick
the leaves from the stalks, and fill a
bottle or jar with them. Add vinegar to
them until the bottle is full; <i>cover closely</i>
to exclude the air, and let it infuse for a
fortnight. Then strain the liquor, and
put it into small bottles for use, of which
the corks should be sealed. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This
should be made in June, July or
August.</p>


<h3>MOCK TURTLE SOUP.</h3>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ a calf’s head, ¼ lb. of
butter, ¼ lb. of lean ham, 2 tablespoonfuls
of minced parsley, a little minced
lemon thyme, sweet marjoram, basil,
2 onions, a few chopped mushrooms
(when obtainable), 2 shalots, 2 tablespoonfuls
of flour, ¼ bottle of Madeira or
sherry, forcemeat balls, cayenne, salt
and mace to taste, the juice of 1 lemon
and 1 Seville orange, 1 dessertspoonful of
pounded sugar, 3 quarts of best stock.
<i>Mode.</i>—Scald the head with the skin on,
remove the brain, tie the head up in a
cloth, and let it boil for 1 hour. Then
take the meat from the bones, cut it into
small square pieces, and throw them into
cold water. Now take the meat, put it
into a stewpan, and cover with stock;
let it boil gently for an hour, or rather
more, if not quite tender, and set it on
one side. Melt the butter in another
stewpan, and add the ham, cut small,
with the herbs, parsley, onions, shalots,
mushrooms, and nearly a pint of stock;
let these simmer slowly for 2 hours, and
then dredge in as much flour as will dry
up the butter. Fill up with the remainder
of the stock, add the wine, let it stew
gently for 10 minutes, rub it through a
tammy, and put it to the calf’s head;
season with cayenne, and, if required, a
little salt; add the juice of the orange
and lemon; and when liked, ¼ teaspoonful
of pounded mace, and the sugar.
Put in the forcemeat balls, simmer
5 minutes, and serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—4½
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per quart,
or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> without wine or forcemeat
balls. <i>Seasonable</i> in winter. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 10 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The bones of the head should
be well stewed in the liquor it was first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
boiled in, and will make good white
stock, flavoured with vegetables, &amp;c.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="center">(<i>More Economical.</i>)</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A knuckle of veal weighing
5 or 6 lbs., 2 cow-heels, 2 large onions
stuck with cloves, 1 bunch of sweet
herbs, 3 blades of mace, salt to taste,
12 peppercorns, 1 glass of sherry, 24
forcemeat balls, a little lemon-juice,
4 quarts of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Put all the
ingredients, except the forcemeat balls
and lemon-juice, in an earthen jar, and
stew for 6 hours. Do not open it till
cold. When wanted for use, skim off all
the fat, and strain carefully; place it on
the fire, cut up the meat into inch-and-a-half
squares, put it, with the forcemeat
balls and lemon-juice, into the soup, and
serve. It can be flavoured with a tablespoonful
of anchovy, or Harvey’s sauce.
<i>Time.</i>—6 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
per quart. <i>Seasonable</i> in winter. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 10 persons.</p>


<h3>MUFFINS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every quart of milk
allow 1½ oz. of German yeast, a little
salt; flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Warm the milk,
add to it the yeast, and mix these well
together; put them into a pan, and stir
in sufficient
flour to make
the whole into
a dough of
rather a soft
consistence;
cover it over with a cloth, and place it
in a warm place to rise, and, when light
and nicely risen, divide the dough into
pieces, and round them to the proper
shape with the hands; place them in a
layer of flour about two inches thick, on
wooden trays, and let them rise again:
when this is effected, they each will
exhibit a semi-globular shape. Then
place them carefully on a hot plate or
stove, and bake them until they are
slightly browned, turning them when
they are done on one side. Muffins are
not easily made, and are more generally
purchased than manufactured at home.
<i>To toast them</i>, divide the edge of the
muffin all round, by pulling it open to
the depth of about an inch, with the
fingers. Put it on a toasting-fork, and
hold it before a very clear fire until one
side is nicely browned, but not burnt;
turn, and toast it on the other. Do not
toast them too quickly, as, if this be
done, the middle of the muffin will not
be warmed through. When done, divide
them by pulling them open; butter
them slightly on both sides, put them
together again, and cut them into
halves: when sufficient are toasted and
buttered, pile them on a very hot dish,
and send them very quickly to table.
<i>Time.</i>—From 20 minutes to ½ hour to
bake them. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1 muffin
to each person.</p>

<h3>MULBERRIES, Preserved.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To 2 lbs. of fruit and
1 pint of juice allow 2½ lbs. of loaf sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put some of the fruit into a preserving
pan, and simmer it gently until
the juice is well drawn. Strain it through
a bag, measure it, and to every pint
allow the above proportion of sugar and
fruit. Put the sugar into the preserving-pan,
moisten it with the juice, boil it up,
skim well, and then add the mulberries,
which should be ripe, but not soft enough
to break to a pulp. Let them stand in
the syrup till warm through, then set
them on the fire to boil gently; when
half done, turn them carefully into an
earthen pan, and let them remain till the
next day; then boil them as before, and
when the syrup is thick, and becomes
firm when cold, put the preserve into
pots. In making this, care should be
taken not to break the mulberries: this
may be avoided by very gentle stirring,
and by simmering the fruit very slowly.
<i>Time.</i>—¾ hour to extract the juice;
¼ hour to boil the mulberries the first
time, ¼ hour the second time. <i>Seasonable</i>
in August and September.</p>


<h3>MULLAGATAWNY SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 tablespoonfuls of curry
powder, 6 onions, 1 clove of garlic, 1 oz.
of pounded almonds, a little lemon-pickle,
or mango-juice, to taste; 1 fowl
or rabbit; 4 slices of lean bacon; 2 quarts
of medium stock, or, if wanted very
good, best stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice and fry
the onions of a nice colour; line the
stewpan with the bacon; cut up the
rabbit or fowl into small joints, and
slightly brown them; put in the fried
onions, the garlic, and stock and simmer
gently till the meat is tender, skim very
carefully, and when the meat is done,
rub the curry powder to a smooth batter:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
add it to the soup with the almonds,
which must be first pounded with a little
of the stock. Put in seasoning and
lemon-pickle or mango-juice to taste, and
serve boiled rice with it. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
in winter. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This soup can also be made
with breast of veal, or calf’s head. Vegetable
mullagatawny is made with veal
stock, by boiling and pulping chopped
vegetable marrow, cucumbers, onions,
and tomatoes, and seasoning with curry
powder and cayenne. Nice pieces of
meat, good curry powder, and strong
stock, are necessary to make this soup
good.</p>


<h3>MULLET, Grey.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of salt to each
gallon of water. <i>Mode.</i>—If the fish be
very large, it should be laid in cold
water, and gradually brought to a boil;
if small, put it in boiling water, salted
in the above proportion. Serve with
anchovy sauce and plain melted butter.
<i>Time.</i>—According to size, ¼ to ¾ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> from
July to October.</p>


<h3>MULLET, Red.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Oiled paper, thickening
of butter and flour, ½ teaspoonful of anchovy
sauce, 1 glass of sherry; cayenne
and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Clean the
fish, take out the gills, but leave the
inside, fold in oiled paper, and bake them
gently. When done, take the liquor that
flows from the fish, add a thickening of
butter kneaded with flour; put in the
other ingredients, and let it boil for
2 minutes. Serve the sauce in a tureen,
and the fish, either with or without the
paper cases. <i>Time.</i>—About 25 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time, but more plentiful in summer.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Red mullet may be broiled, and
should be folded in oiled paper, the same
as in the preceding recipe, and seasoned
with pepper and salt. They may be
served without sauce; but if any is required,
use melted butter, Italian or
anchovy sauce. They should never be
plain boiled.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOM KETCHUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each peck of mushrooms
½ lb. of salt; to each quart of
mushroom-liquor ¼ oz. of cayenne, ½ oz.
of allspice, ½ oz. of ginger, 2 blades of
pounded mace. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose full-grown
mushroom flaps, and take care
they are perfectly <i>fresh gathered</i> when
the weather is tolerably dry; for, if they
are picked during very heavy rain, the
ketchup from which they are made is
liable to get musty, and will not keep
long. Put a layer of them in a deep pan,
sprinkle salt over them, and then another
layer of mushrooms, and so on alternately.
Let them remain for a few
hours, when break them up with the
hand; put them in a nice cool place for
3 days, occasionally stirring and mashing
them well, to extract from them as much
juice as possible. Now measure the
quantity of liquor without straining, and
to each quart allow the above proportion
of spices, &amp;c. Put all into a stone jar,
cover it up very closely, put it in a
saucepan of boiling water, set it over
the fire, and let it boil for 3 hours. Have
ready a nice clean stewpan; turn into it
the contents of the jar, and let the whole
simmer very gently for ½ hour; pour it
into a jug, where it should stand in a
cool place till the next day; then pour it
off into another jug, and strain it into
very dry clean bottles, and do not squeeze
the mushrooms. To each pint of ketchup
add a few drops of brandy. Be careful
not to shake the contents, but leave all
the sediment behind in the jug; cork
well, and either seal or rosin the cork, so
as perfectly to exclude the air. When a
very clear bright ketchup is wanted, the
liquor must be strained through a very
fine hair-sieve, or flannel bag, <i>after</i> it has
been very gently poured off; if the operation
is not successful, it must be repeated
until you have quite a clear liquor. It
should be examined occasionally, and if
it is spoiling, should be reboiled with a
few peppercorns. <i>Seasonable</i> from the
beginning of September to the middle of
October, when this ketchup should be
made.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This flavouring ingredient, if
genuine and well prepared, is one of the
most useful store sauces to the experienced
cook, and no trouble should be spared in
its preparation. Double ketchup is made
by reducing the liquor to half the quantity;
for example, 1 quart must be boiled
down to 1 pint. This goes farther than
ordinary ketchup, as so little is required
to flavour a good quantity of gravy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
The sediment may also be bottled for
immediate use, and will be found to
answer for flavouring <i>thick</i> soups or
gravies.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOM POWDER (a valuable
addition to Sauces and
Gravies, when fresh Mushrooms
are not obtainable).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ peck of large mushrooms,
2 onions, 12 cloves, ¼ oz. of
pounded mace, 2 teaspoonfuls of white
pepper. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel the mushrooms,
wipe them perfectly free from grit and
dirt, remove the black fur, and reject all
those that are at all worm-eaten; put
them into a stewpan with the above
ingredients, but without water; shake
them over a clear fire, till all the liquor
is dried up, and be careful not to let
them burn; arrange them on tins, and
dry them in a slow oven; pound them to
a fine powder, which put into small <i>dry</i>
bottles; cork well, seal the corks, and
keep it in a dry place. In using this
powder, add it to the gravy just before
serving, when it will merely require one
boil-up. The flavour imparted by this
means to the gravy, ought to be exceedingly
good. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This should be
made in September, or at the beginning
of October.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—If the bottles in which it is
stored away are not perfectly dry, as,
also, the mushroom powder, it will keep
good but a very short time.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOM SAUCE, very rich
and good, to serve with Fowls
or Rabbits.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of mushroom-buttons,
salt to taste, a little grated nutmeg,
1 blade of pounded mace, 1 pint of
cream, 2 oz. of butter, flour to thicken.
<i>Mode.</i>—Rub the buttons with a piece of
flannel and salt, to take off the skin;
cut off the stalks, and put them in a
stewpan with the above ingredients,
previously kneading together the butter
and flour; boil the whole for about ten
minutes, stirring all the time. Pour
some of the sauce over the fowls, and
the remainder serve in a tureen. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
to serve with a pair of fowls. <i>Seasonable</i>
from August to October.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOM SAUCE, Brown, to
serve with Roast Meat, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>— ½ pint of button mushrooms,
½ pint of good beef gravy, 1 tablespoonful
of mushroom ketchup (if at
hand), thickening of butter and flour.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the gravy into a saucepan,
thicken it, and stir over the fire until it
boils. Prepare the mushrooms by cutting
off the stalks, and wiping them free from
grit and dirt; the large flap mushrooms
cut into small pieces will answer for a
brown sauce, when the buttons are not
obtainable; put them into the gravy,
and let them simmer very gently for
about 10 minutes; then add the ketchup,
and serve. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more than
10 minutes. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to
October.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When fresh mushrooms are not
obtainable, the powder may be used as
a substitute for brown sauce.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOM SAUCE, White, to
serve with Boiled Fowls, Cutlets,
&amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Rather more than ½ pint
of button mushrooms, lemon-juice, and
water, 1 oz. of butter, ½ pint of Béchamel,
¼ teaspoonful of pounded sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Turn
the mushrooms white by putting
them into lemon-juice and water, having
previously cut off the stalks and wiped
them perfectly free from grit. Chop
them, and put them in a stewpan with
the butter. When the mushrooms are
softened, add the Béchamel, and simmer
for about 5 minutes; should they, however,
not be done enough, allow rather
more time. They should not boil longer
than necessary, as they would then lose
their colour and flavour. Rub the whole
through a tammy, and serve very hot.
After this, it should be warmed in a bain
marie. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether ¼ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from August
to October.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOM SAUCE, White, to
serve with Boiled Fowls, Cutlets,
&amp;c. (a more simple Method).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>— ½ pint of melted butter,
made with milk, ½ pint of button mushrooms,
1 dessertspoonful of mushroom
ketchup, if at hand; cayenne and salt to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Make the melted butter
with milk, and add to it the mushrooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which must be nicely cleaned, and free
from grit, and the stalks cut off. Let
them simmer gently for about 10 minutes,
or until they are quite tender.
Put in the seasoning and ketchup; let
it just boil, when serve. <i>Time.</i>—Rather
more than 10 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
8<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from August to October.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOMS, Baked (a Breakfast,
Luncheon, or Supper Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—16 to 20 mushroom-flaps,
butter, pepper to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—For
this mode of cooking, the mushroom-flaps
are better than the buttons, and
should not be too large. Cut off a portion
of the stalk, peel the top, and wipe
the mushrooms carefully with a piece of
flannel and a little fine salt. Put them
into a tin baking-dish, with a very small
piece of butter placed on each mushroom;
sprinkle over a little pepper, and
let them bake for about 20 minutes, or
longer should the mushrooms be very
large. Have ready a <i>very hot</i> dish, pile
the mushrooms high in the centre, pour
the gravy round, and send them to table
quickly, with very <i>hot</i> plates. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes; large mushrooms, ½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> each for large mushroom-flaps.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Meadow mushrooms in
September and October; cultivated
mushrooms may be had at any time.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOMS, Broiled (a Breakfast,
Luncheon, or Supper Dish).</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/illus-203.jpg" width="192" height="70" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">BROILED MUSHROOMS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Mushroom-flaps, pepper
and salt to taste, butter, lemon-juice.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse the mushrooms by
wiping them
with a piece
of flannel and
a little salt; cut
off a portion of
the stalk, and
peel the tops;
broil them over a clear fire, turning
them once, and arrange them on a very
hot dish. Put a small piece of butter on
each mushroom, season with pepper
and salt, and squeeze over them a few
drops of lemon-juice. Place the dish
before the fire, and when the butter is
melted, serve very hot and quickly.
Moderate-sized flaps are better suited to
this mode of cooking than the buttons:
the latter are better in stews. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes for medium-sized mushrooms.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> each for large mushrooms.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 3 or 4 mushrooms
to each person. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Meadow
mushrooms in September and
October; cultivated mushrooms may be
had at any time.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOMS, Dried.</h3>

<p><i>Mode.</i>—Wipe them clean, take away
the brown part, and peel off the skin;
lay them on sheets of paper to dry, in a
cool oven, when they will shrivel considerably.
Keep them in paper bags,
which hang in a dry place. When
wanted for use, put them into cold
gravy, bring them gradually to simmer,
and it will be found that they will regain
nearly their usual size.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOMS, Pickled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sufficient vinegar to
cover the mushrooms; to each quart of
mushrooms, 2 blades of pounded mace,
1 oz. of ground pepper, salt to taste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Choose some nice young button
mushrooms for pickling, and rub off the
skin with a piece of flannel and salt, and
cut off the stalks; if very large, take out
the red inside, and reject the black ones,
as they are too old. Put them into a stewpan,
sprinkle salt over them, with
pounded mace and pepper in the above
proportion; shake them well over a clear
fire until the liquor flows, and keep them
there until they are all dried up again;
then add as much vinegar as will cover
them; just let it simmer for 1 minute,
and store it away in stone jars for use.
When cold, tie down with bladder and
keep in a dry place: they will remain
good for a length of time, and are generally
considered delicious. <i>Seasonable.</i>—-Make
this the same time as ketchup,
from the beginning of September to the
middle of October.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOMS, to Preserve.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each quart of mushrooms,
allow 3 oz. butter, pepper and
salt to taste, the juice of 1 lemon, clarified
butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel the mushrooms,
put them into cold water, with
a little lemon-juice; take them out and
<i>dry</i> them very carefully in a cloth. Put
the butter into a stewpan capable of
holding the mushrooms; when it is
melted, add the mushrooms, lemon-juice,
and a seasoning of pepper and
salt; draw them down over a slow fire,
and let them remain until their liquor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
boiled away, and they have become quite
dry, but be careful in not allowing them
to stick to the bottom of the stewpan.
When done, put them into pots, and
pour over the top clarified butter. If
wanted for immediate use, they will
keep good a few days without being covered
over. To re-warm them, put the
mushrooms into a stewpan, strain the
butter from them, and they will be
ready for use. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> each.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Meadow mushrooms in September
and October; cultivated mushrooms
may be had at any time.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOMS, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint mushroom-buttons,
3 oz. of fresh butter, white pepper
and salt to taste, lemon-juice, 1 teaspoonful
of flour, cream or milk, ¼ teaspoonful
of grated nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
off the ends of the stalks, and pare
neatly a pint of mushroom-buttons; put
them into a basin of water, with a little
lemon juice, as they are done. When
all are prepared, take them from the
water with the hands, to avoid the sediment,
and put them into a stewpan with
the fresh butter, white pepper, salt, and
the juice of ½ lemon; cover the pan
closely, and let the mushrooms stew
gently from 20 to 25 minutes; then
thicken the butter with the above proportion
of flour, add gradually sufficient
cream, or cream and milk, to
make the sauce of a proper consistency,
and put in the grated nutmeg. If the
mushrooms are not perfectly tender,
stew them for 5 minutes longer, remove
every particle of butter which may be
floating on the top, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, from 9<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per
pint. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Meadow mushrooms in September
and October.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOMS, Stewed in Gravy.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of mushroom-buttons,
1 pint of brown gravy, ¼ teaspoonful
of grated nutmeg, cayenne and salt
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a pint of brown
gravy, cut nearly all the stalks away
from the mushrooms and peel the tops;
put them into a stewpan, with the gravy,
and simmer them gently from 20 minutes
to ½ hour. Add the nutmeg and a seasoning
of cayenne and salt, and serve very hot.
<i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to ½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per pint. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5
or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Meadow
mushrooms in September and October.</p>


<h3>MUSTARD, How to Mix.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Mustard, salt and water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Mustard should be mixed
with water that has been boiled and allowed
to cool; hot water destroys its
essential properties, and raw cold water
might cause it to ferment. Put the
mustard into a cup, with a small pinch of
salt, and mix with it very gradually sufficient
boiled water to make it drop from
the spoon without being watery. Stir
and mix well, and rub the lumps well
down with the back of a spoon, as well-mixed
mustard should be perfectly free
from these. The mustard-pot should not
be more than half-full, or rather less if
it will not be used for a day or two, as it
is so much better when it is freshly
mixed.</p>


<h3>MUSTARD, Indian, an excellent
Relish to Bread and Butter, or
any cold Meat.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of the best mustard,
¼ lb. of flour, ½ oz. of salt, 4 shalots, 4
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 4 tablespoonfuls
of ketchup, ¼ bottle of anchovy
sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the mustard, flour,
and salt into a basin, and make them
into a stiff paste with boiling water.
Boil the shalots with the vinegar, ketchup,
and anchovy sauce, for 10 minutes,
and pour the whole, <i>boiling</i>, over the
mixture in the basin; stir well, and reduce
it to a proper thickness; put it into
a bottle, with a bruised shalot at the
bottom, and store away for use. This
makes an excellent relish, and if properly
prepared will keep for years.</p>


<h3>MUSTARD, Tartar.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Horseradish vinegar,
cayenne, ½ a teacupful of mustard. <i>Mode.</i>—Have
ready sufficient horseradish vinegar
to mix with the above proportion of
mustard; put the mustard into a cup,
with a slight seasoning of cayenne; mix
it perfectly smooth with the vinegar,
adding this a little at a time; rub down
with the back of a spoon any lumps that
may appear, and do not let it be too
thin. Mustard may be flavoured in
various ways, with Tarragon, shalot,
celery, and many other vinegars, herbs,
spices, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>MUTTON.</h3>

<p>Almost every large city has a particular
manner of cutting up, or, as it is
called, dressing the carcase. In London
this process is very simple, and as our
butchers have found that much skewering
back, doubling one part over another,
or scoring the inner cuticle or fell, tends
to spoil the meat and shorten the time it
would otherwise keep, they avoid all
such treatment entirely. The carcase
when flayed (which operation is performed
while yet warm), the sheep when
hung up
and the
head removed,
presents
the
profile
shown in
our cut;
the small
numerals
indicating
the parts or
joints into
which one-half
of the
animal is
cut. After
separating
the hind
from the
fore quarters,
with
eleven ribs
to the latter,
the
quarters
are usually
subdivided
in the manner
shown
in the
sketch, in
which the
several joints are defined by the intervening
lines and figures. <i>Hind quarter</i>:
No. 1, the leg; 2, the loin—the two,
when cut in one piece, being called
the saddle. <i>Fore quarter</i>: No. 3, the
shoulder; 4 and 5 the neck; No. 5
being called, for distinction, the scrag,
which is generally afterwards separated
from 4, the lower and better joint; No.
6, the breast. The haunch of mutton,
so often served at public dinners and
special entertainments, comprises all the
leg and so much of the loin, short of the
ribs or lap, as is indicated on the upper
part of the carcase by a dotted line.</p>

THE SEVERAL JOINTS.</div>
</div>


<h3>MUTTON, Baked Minced.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—The
remains of any joint of cold roast
mutton, 1 or 2 onions, 1 bunch of
savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste,
2 blades of pounded mace or nutmeg,
1 teacupful of gravy, mashed potatoes.
<i>Mode.</i>—Mince an onion rather
fine, and fry it a light-brown colour;
add the herbs and mutton, both of
which should be also finely minced
and well mixed; season with pepper
and salt, and a little pounded mace or
nutmeg, and moisten with the above
proportion of gravy. Put a layer of
mashed potatoes at the bottom of a
dish, then the mutton, and then another
layer of potatoes, and bake for about
½ hour. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
exclusive of the meat, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—If there should be a large quantity
of meat, use 2 onions instead of 1.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Boiled Breast of, and
Caper Sauce.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Breast of mutton, bread-crumbs,
2 tablespoonfuls of minced savoury
herbs (put a large proportion of
parsley), pepper and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
off the superfluous fat; bone the
meat; sprinkle over a layer of bread-crumbs,
minced herbs, and seasoning;
roll, and bind it up firmly. Boil <i>gently</i> for
2 hours, remove the tape, and serve with
caper sauce, a little of which should be
poured over the meat. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for
4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, an excellent way to
cook a Breast of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Breast of mutton, 2
onions, salt and pepper to taste, flour,
a bunch of savoury herbs, green peas.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut the mutton into pieces
about 2 inches square, and let it be
tolerably lean; put it into a stewpan,
with a little fat or butter, and fry it of a
nice brown; then dredge in a little flour,
slice the onions, and put it with the
herbs in the stewpan; pour in sufficient
water <i>just</i> to cover the meat, and simmer
the whole gently until the mutton is
tender. Take out the meat, strain, and
skim off all the fat from the gravy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
put both the meat and gravy back into
the stewpan; add about a quart of
young green peas, and let them boil
gently until done. 2 or 3 slices of bacon
added and stewed with the mutton give
additional flavour; and, to insure the
peas being a beautiful green colour, they
may be boiled in water separately, and
added to the stew at the moment of
serving. <i>Time.</i>—2½ hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
6<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from June to August.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Broiled, and Tomato
Sauce.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—A
few slices of cold mutton, tomato
sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut some nice slices
from a cold leg or shoulder of mutton;
season them with pepper and salt, and
broil over a clear fire. Make some
tomato sauce, pour it over the mutton,
and serve. This makes an excellent
dish, and must be served very hot.
<i>Time.</i>—About 5 minutes to broil the
mutton. <i>Seasonable</i> in September and
October, when tomatoes are plentiful
and seasonable.</p>


<h3>MUTTON BROTH, to Make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of the scrag end of
the neck of mutton, 1 onion, a bunch of
sweet herbs, ½ turnip, 3 pints of water,
pepper and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the mutton into a stewpan; pour over
the water cold, and add the other ingredients.
When it boils, skim it very
carefully, cover the pan closely, and let
it simmer very gently for an hour;
strain it, let it cool, take off all the fat
from the surface, and warm up as much
as may be required, adding, if the
patient be allowed to take it, a teaspoonful
of minced parsley which has been
previously scalded. Pearl barley or rice
are very nice additions to mutton broth,
and should be boiled as long as the
other ingredients. When either of these
is added, the broth must not be strained,
but merely thoroughly skimmed. Plain
mutton broth without seasoning is made
by merely boiling the mutton, water,
and salt together, straining it, letting
the broth cool, skimming all the fat off,
and warming up as much as is required.
This preparation would be very tasteless
and insipid, but likely to agree with
very delicate stomachs, whereas the least
addition of other ingredients would have
the contrary effect. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to make
from 1½ to 2 pints of broth. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Veal broth may be made in
the same manner; the knuckle of a leg
or shoulder is the part usually used for
this purpose. It is very good with the
addition of the inferior joints of a fowl,
or a few shank-bones.</p>


<h3>MUTTON BROTH, to Make
Quickly.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 or 2 chops from a neck
of mutton, 1 pint of water, a small bunch
of sweet herbs, ¼ of an onion, pepper
and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the meat
into small pieces; put it into a saucepan
with the bones, but no skin or fat; add
the other ingredients; cover the saucepan,
and bring the water quickly to boil.
Take the lid off, and continue the rapid
boiling for 20 minutes, skimming it well
during the process; strain the broth
into a basin; if there should be any fat
left on the surface, remove it by laying a
piece of thin paper on the top; the
greasy particles will adhere to the paper,
and so free the preparation from them.
To an invalid nothing is more disagreeable
than broth served with a quantity
of fat floating on the top; to avoid this,
it is always better to allow it to get
thoroughly cool, the fat can then be so
easily removed. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes after
the water boils. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
to make ½ pint of broth. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Haunch of, to Carve.</h3>

<p>A deep cut should, in the first place,
be made quite down to the bone, across
the knuckle-end of the joint, along the
line 1 to 2. This will let the gravy
escape; and then it should be carved, in
not too thick slices, along the whole
length of the haunch, in the direction of
the line from 4 to 3.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 267px;">

<div class="caption">HAUNCH OF MUTTON.</div>
</div>


<h3>MUTTON, Leg of, to Carve.</h3>

<p>This homely, but capital English joint,
is almost invariably served at table as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
shown in the engraving. The carving
of it is not very difficult: the knife
should be carried sharply down in the
direction of the line from 1 to 2, and
slices taken from
either side, as the
guests may desire,
some liking
the knuckle-end,
as well done, and
others preferring
the more underdone
part. The
fat should be sought near the line 3 to 4.
Some connoisseurs are fond of having this
joint dished with the under-side uppermost,
so as to get at the finely-grained
meat lying under that part of the joint,
known as the Pope’s eye; but this is an
extravagant fashion, and one that will
hardly find favour in the eyes of many
economical British housewives and housekeepers.</p>

<h3>MUTTON, Loin of, to Carve.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 211px;">
<img src="images/illus-207b.jpg" width="211" height="115" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">LOIN OF MUTTON.</div>
</div>

<p>There is one point in connection with
carving a loin of mutton which includes
every other; that is, that the joint
should be thoroughly well jointed by the
butcher before
it is cooked.
This knack of
jointing requires
practice
and the proper
tools; and no
one but the
butcher is supposed
to have these. If the bones be
not well jointed, the carving of a loin of
mutton is not a gracious business;
whereas, if that has been attended to,
it is an easy and untroublesome task.
The knife should be inserted at fig. 1,
and after feeling your way between the
bones, it should be carried sharply in
the direction of the line 1 to 2. As
there are some people who prefer the
outside cut, while others do not like it,
the question as to their choice of this
should be asked.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Saddle of, to Carve.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 212px;">
<img src="images/illus-207c.jpg" width="212" height="116" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">SADDLE OF MUTTON.</div>
</div>

<p>Although we have heard, at various
intervals, growlings expressed at the
inevitable “saddle of mutton” at the
dinner-parties of our middle classes, yet
we doubt whether any other joint is
better liked, when it has been well hung
and artistically cooked. There is a diversity
of opinion respecting the mode of
sending this joint to table; but it has
only reference
to whether or
no there shall
be any portion
of the tail,
or, if so, how
many joints of
the tail. Some
trim the tail
with a paper frill. The carving is not
difficult: it is usually cut in the direction
of the line from 2 to 1, quite down to
the bones, in evenly-sliced pieces. A
fashion, however, patronized by some, is
to carve it obliquely, in the direction of
the line from 4 to 3; in which case the
joint would be turned round the other
way, having the tail end on the right of
the carver.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Shoulder of, to Carve.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 193px;">
<img src="images/illus-207d.jpg" width="193" height="109" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">SHOULDER OF MUTTON.</div>
</div>

<p>This is a joint not difficult to carve.
The knife should be drawn from the
outer edge of the shoulder in the direction
of the line from 1 to 2, until the
bone of the
shoulder is
reached. As
many slices as
can be carved
in this manner
should be
taken, and afterwards
the
meat lying on each side of the blade-bone
should be served, by carving in the
direction of 3 to 4 and 5 to 6. The uppermost
side of the shoulder being now
finished, the joint should be turned, and
slices taken off along its whole length.
There are some who prefer this under-side
of the shoulder for its juicy flesh,
although the grain of the meat is not so
fine as that on the other side.</p>

<h3>MUTTON, Braised Fillet of, with
French Beans.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The chump end of a loin
of mutton, buttered paper, French beans,
a little glaze, 1 pint of gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Roll
up the mutton in a piece of buttered
paper, roast it for 2 hours, and do not
allow it to acquire the least colour. Have
ready some French beans, boiled, and
drained on a sieve; remove the paper
from the mutton, glaze it; just heat up
the beans in the gravy, and lay them on
the dish with the meat over them. The
remainder of the gravy may be strained,
and sent to table in a tureen. <i>Time.</i>—2
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 8½<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at

<h3>MUTTON, Haricot.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 lbs. of the middle or
best end of the neck of mutton, 3 carrots,
3 turnips, 3 onions, pepper and
salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup
or Harvey’s sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Trim off
some of the fat, cut the mutton into
rather thin chops, and put them into a
frying-pan with the fat trimmings. Fry
of a pale brown, but do not cook them
enough for eating. Cut the carrots and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
turnips into dice, and the onions into
slices, and slightly fry them in the same
fat that the mutton was browned in, but
do not allow them to take any colour.
Now lay the mutton at the bottom of a
stewpan, then the vegetables, and pour
over them just sufficient boiling water to
cover the whole. Give the boil, skim
well, and then set the pan on the side of
the fire to simmer gently until the meat
is tender. Skim off every particle of fat,
add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and
a little ketchup, and serve. This dish
is very much better if made the day
before it is wanted for table, as the fat
can be so much more easily removed
when the gravy is cold. This should be
particularly attended to, as it is apt to be
rich and greasy if eaten the same day it
is made. It should be served in rather
a deep dish. <i>Time.</i>—2½ hours to simmer
gently. <i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity,
3<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Haricot.</h3>

sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the mutton
into square pieces, and fry them a nice
colour; then dredge over them a little
flour and a seasoning of pepper and salt.
Put all into a stewpan, and moisten with
boiling water, adding the onion, stuck
with 3 cloves, the mace, and herbs.
Simmer gently till the meat is done, skim
off all the fat, and then add the carrots
and turnips, which should be previously
cut in dice and fried in a little sugar to
colour them. Let the whole simmer
again for 10 minutes; take out the onion
and bunch of herbs, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—About
3 hours to simmer. <i>Average cost</i>,
6<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

1 head of celery. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the cold
mutton into moderate-sized chops, and
take off the fat; slice the onions, and
fry them with the chops, in a little butter,
of a nice brown colour; stir in the flour,
add the gravy, and let it stew gently
nearly an hour. In the mean time boil
the vegetables until <i>nearly</i> tender, slice
them, and add them to the mutton
about ¼ hour before it is to be served.
Season with pepper and salt, add the
ketchup and port wine, give one boil,
and serve. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour. <i>Average

shoulder or leg of mutton, 6 whole peppers,
6 whole allspice, a faggot of savoury
herbs, ½ head of celery, 1 onion, 2 oz. of
butter, flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the meat in
nice even slices from the bones, trimming
off all superfluous fat and gristle;
chop the bones and fragments of the
joints, put them into a stewpan with the
pepper, spice, herbs, and celery; cover
with water, and simmer for 1 hour.
Slice and fry the onion of a nice pale-brown
colour, dredge in a little flour to
make it thick, and add this to the bones,
&amp;c. Stew for ¼ hour, strain the gravy,
and let it cool; then skim off every particle
of fat, and put it, with the meat,
into a stewpan. Flavour with ketchup,
Harvey’s sauce, tomato sauce, or any
flavouring that may be preferred, and
let the meat gradually warm through,
but not boil, or it will harden. To hash
meat properly, it should be laid in cold
gravy, and only left on the fire just long
enough to warm through. <i>Time.</i>—1½
hour to simmer the gravy. <i>Average cost</i>,
exclusive of the meat, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Roast Haunch of.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 291px;">
<img src="images/illus-209.jpg" width="291" height="106" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">HAUNCH OF MUTTON.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Haunch of mutton, a
little salt, flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Let this joint
hang as long as possible without becoming
tainted, and while hanging dust flour
over it, which keeps off the flies, and
prevents the air from getting to it. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
not well hung, the joint, when it comes
to table, will do credit neither to the
butcher nor the cook, as it will not be
tender. Wash the outside well, lest it
should have a bad flavour from keeping;
then flour it and put it down to a nice
brisk fire, at some distance, so that it
may gradually warm through. Keep
continually basting, and about ½ hour
before it is served, draw it nearer to the
fire to get nicely brown. Sprinkle a little
fine salt over the meat, pour off the
dripping, add a little boiling water
slightly salted, and strain this over the
joint. Place a paper ruche on the bone,
and send red-currant jelly and gravy in a
tureen to table with it. <i>Time.</i>—About 4
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 8 to 10 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—In
best season from September to March.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Boiled Leg of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Mutton, water, salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—A leg of mutton for boiling
should not hang too long, as it will not
look a good colour when dressed. Cut
off the shank-bone, trim the knuckle,
and wash and wipe it very clean; plunge
it into sufficient boiling water to cover it;
let it boil up, then draw the saucepan to
the side of the fire, where it should remain
till the finger can be borne in the
water. Then place it sufficiently near
the fire, that the water may gently
simmer, and be very careful that it does
not boil fast, or the meat will be hard.
Skim well, add a little salt, and in about
2¼ hours after the water begins to simmer,
a moderate-sized leg of mutton will
be done. Serve with carrots and mashed
turnips, which may be boiled with the
meat, and send caper sauce to table with
it in a tureen. <i>Time.</i>—A moderate-sized
leg of mutton of 9 lbs., 2¼ hours after the
water boils; one of 12 lbs., 3 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 8½<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—A
moderate-sized leg of mutton for 6 or
8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> nearly all the
year, but not so good in June, July, and
August.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When meat is liked very <i>thoroughly</i>
cooked, allow more time than
stated above. The liquor this joint was
boiled in should be converted into soup.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Boned Leg of, Stuffed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A small leg of mutton,
weighing 6 or 7 lbs., forcemeat, 2 shalots
finely minced. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a forcemeat,
to which add 2 finely-minced shalots.
Bone the leg of mutton, without
spoiling the skin, and cut off a great deal
of the fat. Fill the hole up whence the
bone was taken with the forcemeat, and
sew it up underneath, to prevent its
falling out. Bind and tie it up compactly,
and roast it before a nice clear
fire for about 2½ hours or rather longer;
remove the tape and send it to table with
a good gravy. It may be glazed or not,
as preferred. <i>Time.</i>—2½ hours, or rather
longer. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Braised Leg of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 small leg of mutton, 4
carrots, 3 onions, 1 faggot of savoury
herbs, a bunch of parsley, seasoning to
taste of pepper and salt, a few slices of
bacon, a few veal trimmings, ½ pint of
gravy or water. <i>Mode.</i>—Line the bottom
of a braising-pan with a few slices
of bacon, put in the carrots, onions,
herbs, parsley, and seasoning, and over
these place the mutton. Cover the
whole with a few more slices of bacon
and the veal trimmings, pour in the
gravy or water, and stew very <i>gently</i> for
4 hours. Strain the gravy, reduce it to
a glaze over a sharp fire, glaze the mutton
with it, and send it to table, placed
on a dish of white haricot beans boiled
tender, or garnished with glazed onions.
<i>Time.</i>—4 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at

<img src="images/illus-210.jpg" width="292" height="135" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">LEG OF MUTTON.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Leg of mutton, a little
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—As mutton, when freshly
killed, is never tender, hang it almost as
long as it will keep; flour it, and put it
in a cool airy place for a few days, if the
weather will permit. Wash off the
flour, wipe it very dry, and cut off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
shank-bone; put it down to a brisk clear
fire, dredge with flour, and keep continually
basting the whole time it is
cooking. About 20 minutes before
serving, draw it near the fire to get
nicely brown; sprinkle over it a little
salt, dish the meat, pour off the dripping,
add some boiling water slightly salted,
strain it over the joint, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—A
leg of mutton weighing 10 lbs.,
about 2¼ or 2½ hours; one of 7 lbs.,
about 2 hours, or rather less. <i>Average
cost</i>, 8½<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—A moderate-sized
leg of mutton sufficient for 6
or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time,
but not so good in June, July, and
August.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Roast Loin of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Loin of mutton, a little
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut and trim off the superfluous
fat, and see that the butcher joints
the meat properly, as thereby much
annoyance is saved to the carver, when
it comes to table. Have ready a nice
clear fire (it need not be a very wide
large one), put down the meat, dredge
with flour, and baste well until it is done.
Make the gravy as for roast leg of mutton,
and serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—A loin
of mutton weighing 6 lbs., 1½ hour, or
rather longer. <i>Average cost</i>, 8½<i>d</i>, per lb.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<div class="caption">LOIN OF MUTTON.</div>
</div>


<h3>MUTTON, Rolled loin of (very
Excellent).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—About 6 lbs. of a loin of
mutton, ½ teaspoonful of pepper, ¼ teaspoonful
of pounded allspice, ¼ teaspoonful
of mace, ¼ teaspoonful of nutmeg,
6 cloves, forcemeat, 1 glass of port wine,
2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.
<i>Mode.</i>—Hang the mutton till tender,
bone it, and sprinkle over it pepper,
mace, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg in the
above proportion, all of which must be
pounded very fine. Let it remain for a
day, then make a forcemeat, cover the
meat with it, and roll and bind it up
firmly. Half bake it in a slow oven, let
it grow cold, take off the fat, and put the
gravy into a stewpan; flour the meat,
put it in the gravy, and stew it till perfectly
tender. Now take out the meat,
unbind it, add to the gravy wine and
ketchup as above, give one boil, and
pour over the meat. Serve with red-currant
jelly; and, if obtainable, a few
mushrooms stewed for a few minutes in
the gravy, will be found a great improvement.
<i>Time.</i>—1½ hour to bake the meat,
1½ hour to stew gently. <i>Average cost</i>,
4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This joint will be found very
nice if rolled and stuffed, as here directed,
and plainly roasted. It should be well
basted, and served with a good gravy and
currant jelly.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Boiled Neck of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 lbs. of the middle, or
best end of the neck of mutton; a little
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Trim off a portion of the
fat, should there be too much, and if it
is to look particularly nice, the chine-bone
should be sawn down, the ribs
stripped half-way down, and the ends of
the bones chopped off; this is, however,
not necessary. Put the meat into sufficient
<i>boiling</i> water to cover it; when it
boils, add a little salt and remove all the
scum. Draw the saucepan to the side of
the fire, and let the water get so cool that
the finger may be borne in it; then simmer
very <i>slowly</i> and gently until the meat
is done, which will be in about 1½ hour,
or rather more, reckoning from the time
that it begins to simmer. Serve with
turnips and caper sauce, and pour a little
of it over the meat. The turnips should
be boiled with the mutton; and when at
hand, a few carrots will also be found an
improvement. These, however, if very
large and thick, must be cut into long
thinnish pieces, or they will not be sufficiently
done by the time the mutton is
ready. Garnish the dish with carrots
and turnips, placed alternately round the
mutton. <i>Time.</i>—4 lbs. of the neck of
mutton, about 1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
8½<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or 7 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

2 onions sliced, ½ pint of water, 2 small
carrots, 2 turnips, pepper and salt to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the mutton into small
chops, and trim off the greater portion
of the fat; put the butter into a stewpan,
dredge in a little flour, add the
sliced onions, and keep stirring till
brown; then put in the meat. When
this is quite brown, add the water, and
the carrots and turnips, which should be
cut into very thin slices; season with
pepper and salt, and stew till quite tender,
which will be in about ¾ hour. When
in season, green peas may be substituted
for the carrots and turnips: they should
be piled in the centre of the dish, and
the chops laid round. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the meat, 4<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i>, with peas, from June to
August.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Roast Neck of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Neck of mutton; a little
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—For roasting, choose the
middle, or the best end, of the neck of
mutton, and if there is a very large proportion
of fat, trim off some of it, and
save it for making into suet puddings,
which will be found exceedingly good.
Let the bones be cut short, and see that
it is properly jointed before it is laid
down to the fire, as they will be more
easily separated when they come to table.
Place the joint at a nice brisk fire, dredge
it with flour, and keep continually basting
until done. A few minutes before
serving, draw it nearer the fire to acquire
a nice colour, sprinkle over it a little
salt, pour off the dripping, add a little
boiling water slightly salted; strain this
over the meat and serve. Red-currant
jelly may be sent to table with it. <i>Time.</i>—4

of 6 oz. of suet to each pound
of flour; a very small quantity of minced
onion (this may be omitted when the
flavour is not liked). <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the
meat into rather thin slices, and season
them with pepper and salt; line the
pudding-dish with crust; lay in the
meat, and nearly, but do not quite, fill
it up with water; when the flavour is
liked, add a small quantity of minced
onion; cover with crust, and proceed in
the same manner as directed in recipe for
<a href="#RUMP-STEAK_AND_KIDNEY_PUDDING">rump steak and kidney pudding</a>. <i>Time.</i>—About
3 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all
the year, but more suitable in winter.</p>


<h3>MUTTON, Roast Saddle of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Saddle of mutton; a little
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—To insure this joint being
tender, let it hang for ten days or a fortnight,
if the weather permits. Cut off
the tail and flaps, and trim away every
part that has not indisputable pretensions
to be eaten, and have the skin
taken off and skewered on again. Put it
down to a bright, clear fire, and, when
the joint has been cooking for an hour,
remove the skin and dredge it with
flour. It should not be placed too near
the fire, as the fat should not be in the
slightest degree burnt, but kept constantly
basted, both before and after
the skin is removed. Sprinkle some salt
over the joint; make a little gravy in the
dripping-pan; pour it over the meat,
which send to table with a tureen of
made gravy and red-currant jelly. <i>Time.</i>—A
saddle of mutton weighing 10 lbs.,
2½ hours; 14 lbs., 3¼ hours. When liked
underdone, allow rather less time. <i>Average
cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—A
moderate-sized saddle of 10 lbs. for
7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the
year; not so good when lamb is in full
season.</p>

<div class="caption">SADDLE OF MUTTON.</div>
</div>


<h3>MUTTON, Roast Shoulder of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Shoulder of mutton; a
little salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the joint down
to a bright, clear fire; flour it well, and
keep continually basting. About ¼ hour
before serving, draw it near the fire, that
the outside may acquire a nice brown
colour, but not sufficiently near to blacken
the fat. Sprinkle a little fine salt over
the meat, empty the dripping-pan of its
contents, pour in a little boiling water
slightly salted, and strain this over the
joint. Onion sauce, or stewed Spanish
onions, are usually sent to table with
this dish, and sometimes baked potatoes.
<i>Time.</i>—A shoulder of mutton weighing
6 or 7 lbs., 1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i>
per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/illus-213b.jpg" width="287" height="147" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">SHOULDER OF MUTTON.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Shoulder of mutton may be
dressed in a variety of ways; boiled,
and served with onion sauce; boned,
and stuffed with a good veal forcemeat;
or baked, with sliced potatoes in the
dripping-pan.</p>


<h3>MUTTON SOUP, Good.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A neck of mutton about
5 or 6 lbs., 3 carrots, 3 turnips, 2 onions,
a large bunch of sweet herbs, including
parsley; salt and pepper to taste; a
little sherry, if liked; 3 quarts of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Lay the ingredients in a covered
pan before the fire, and let them remain
there the whole day, stirring occasionally.
The next day put the whole into a stewpan,
and place it on a brisk fire. When
it commences to boil, take the pan off
the fire, and put it on one side to simmer
until the meat is done. When ready for
use, take out the meat, dish it up with
carrots and turnips, and send it to table;
strain the soup, let it cool, skim off all
the fat, season and thicken it with a
tablespoonful, or rather more, of arrowroot;
flavour with a little sherry, simmer
for 5 minutes, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—15
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, including the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
meat, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>


<h3>NASTURTIUMS, Pickled (a very
good Substitute for Capers).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each pint of vinegar,
1 oz. of salt, 6 peppercorns, nasturtiums.
<i>Mode.</i>—Gather the nasturtium pods on a
dry day, and wipe them clean with a
cloth; put them in a dry glass bottle, with
vinegar, salt, and pepper, in the above
proportion. If you cannot find enough
ripe to fill a bottle, cork up what you
have got until you have some more fit;
they may be added from day to day.
Bung up the bottles, and seal or rosin
the tops. They will be fit for use in 10
or 12 months; and the best way is to
make them one season for the next.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Look for nasturtium-pods
from the end of July to the end of
August.</p>


<h3>NECTARINES, Preserved.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of sugar
allow ¼ pint of water; nectarines. <i>Mode.</i>—Divide
the nectarines in two, take out
the stones, and make a strong syrup with
sugar and water in the above proportion.
Put in the nectarines, and boil them
until they have thoroughly imbibed the
sugar. Keep the fruit as whole as possible,
and turn it carefully into a pan.
The next day boil it again for a few minutes,
take out the nectarines, put them
into jars, boil the syrup quickly for five
minutes, pour it over the fruit, and,
when cold, cover the preserve down.
The syrup and preserve must be carefully
skimmed, or it will not be clear. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes to boil the sugar and water;
20 minutes to boil the fruit the first time,
10 minutes the second time; 5 minutes
to boil the syrup. <i>Seasonable</i> in August
and September, but cheapest in September.</p>


<h3>NECTAR, Welsh.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of raisins, 3 lemons,
2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 2 gallons of boiling
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the peel of the
lemons very thin, pour upon it the boiling
water, and, when cool, add the
strained juice of the lemons, the sugar,
and the raisins, stoned and chopped very
fine. Let it stand 4 or 5 days, stirring
it every day; then strain it through a
jelly-bag, and bottle it for present use.
<i>Time.</i>—4 or 5 days. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> to make 2 gallons.</p>


<h3>NEGUS, to make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every pint of port
wine allow 1 quart of boiling water, ¼ lb.
of sugar, 1 lemon, grated nutmeg to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—As this beverage is more
usually drunk at children’s parties than
at any other, the wine need not be very
old or expensive for the purpose, a new
fruity wine answering very well for it.
Put the wine into a jug, rub some lumps
of sugar (equal to ¼ lb.) on the lemon-rind
until all the yellow part of the skin is
absorbed, then squeeze the juice, and
strain it. Add the sugar and lemon-juice
to the port-wine, with the grated
nutmeg; pour over it the boiling water,
cover the jug, and, when the beverage
has cooled a little, it will be fit for use.
Negus may also be made of sherry, or
any other sweet white wine, but is more
usually made of port than of any other
beverage. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1 pint of
wine, with the other ingredients in proportion,
for a party of 9 or 10 children.</p>

<h3>NOYEAU CREAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ oz. of isinglass, the
juice of 2 lemons, noyeau and pounded
sugar to taste, 1½ pint of cream. <i>Mode.</i>—Dissolve
the isinglass in a little boiling
water, add the lemon-juice, and strain
this to the cream, putting in sufficient
noyeau and sugar to flavour and sweeten
the mixture nicely; whisk the cream
well, put it into an oiled mould, and set
the mould in ice or in a cool place; turn
it out, and garnish the dish to taste.
<i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, with cream at 1<i>s.</i> per pint and the
best isinglass, 4<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill a
quart mould. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>NOYEAU, Home-made.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 oz. of bitter almonds,
1 oz. of sweet ditto, 1 lb. of loaf sugar,
the rinds of 3 lemons, 1 quart of Irish
whiskey or gin, 1 tablespoonful of clarified
honey, ½ pint of new milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch
and pound the almonds, and
mix with them the sugar, which should
also be pounded. Boil the milk; let it
stand till quite cold; then mix all the
ingredients together, and let them remain
for 10 days, shaking them every
day. Filter the mixture through blotting-paper,
bottle off for use in small
bottles, and seal the corks down. This
will be found useful for flavouring many
sweet dishes. A tablespoonful of the
above noyeau, added to a pint of boiled
custard instead of brandy as given in our
recipe for <a href="#CUSTARDS_Boiled">custard</a>, makes an exceedingly
agreeable and delicate flavour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to make
about 2½ pints of noyeau. <i>Seasonable.</i>—May
be made at any time.</p>

<h3>OMELET.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of
salt, ½ saltspoonful of pepper, ¼ lb. of
butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Break the eggs into a
basin, omitting the whites of 3, and beat
them up with
the salt and
pepper until
extremely
light; then
add 2 oz. of
the butter broken into small pieces, and
stir this into the mixture. Put the other
2 oz. of butter into a frying-pan, make it
quite hot, and, as soon as it begins to
bubble, whisk the eggs, &amp;c., very briskly
for a minute or two, and pour them into
the pan; stir the omelet with a spoon one
way until the mixture thickens and becomes
firm, and when the whole is set,
fold the edges over, so that the omelet
assumes an oval form; and when it is
nicely brown on one side, and quite firm,
it is done. To take off the rawness on
the upper side, hold the pan before the
fire for a minute or two, and brown it
with a salamander or hot shovel. Serve
very expeditiously on a very hot dish,
and never cook until it is just wanted.
The flavour of this omelet may be very
much enhanced by adding minced parsley,
minced onion or eschalot, or grated
cheese, allowing 1 tablespoonful of the
former, and half the quantity of the
latter, to the above proportion of eggs.
Shrimps or oysters may also be added:
the latter should be scalded in their
liquor, and then bearded and cut into
small pieces. In making an omelet, be
particularly careful that it is not too thin,
and, to avoid this, do not make it in too
large a frying-pan, as the mixture would
then spread too much, and taste of the
outside. It should also not be greasy,
burnt, or too much done, and should be
cooked over a gentle fire, that the whole
of the substance may be heated without
drying up the outside. Omelets are
sometimes served with gravy; but <i>this
should never be poured over them</i>, but
served in a tureen, as the liquid causes
the omelet to become heavy and flat,
instead of eating light and soft. In
making the gravy, the flavour should
not overpower that of the omelet, and
should be thickened with arrowroot or
rice flour. <i>Time.</i>—With 6 eggs, in a
frying-pan 18 or 20 inches round, 4 to 6
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<h3>OMELET, The Cure’s, or
Omelette au Thon.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Take for 6 persons, the
roes of 2 carp;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> bleach them, by putting
them, for 5 minutes, in boiling water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
slightly salted; a piece of fresh tunny the
size of a hen’s egg, to which add a small
shalot already chopped; hash up together
the roe and the tunny, so as to mix them
well, and throw the whole into a saucepan,
with a sufficient quantity of very
good butter: whip it up until the butter
is melted! This constitutes the specialty
of the omelet. Take a second piece of
butter, <i>à discrétion</i>, mix it with parsley
and herbs, place it in a long-shaped dish
destined to receive the omelet; squeeze
the juice of a lemon over it, and place it
on hot embers. Beat up 12 eggs (the
fresher the better); throw up the sauté
of roe and tunny, stirring it so as to mix
all well together; then make your omelet
in the usual manner, endeavouring to
turn it out long, thick, and soft. Spread
it carefully on the dish prepared for it,
and serve at once. This dish ought to
be reserved for recherché déjeûners, or
for assemblies where amateurs meet who
know how to eat well: washed down
with a good old wine, it will work
wonders.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The roe and the tunny must be
beaten up (sauté) without allowing them
to boil, to prevent their hardening, which
would prevent them mixing well with the
eggs. Your dish should be hollowed
towards the centre, to allow the gravy to
concentrate, that it may be helped with
a spoon. The dish ought to be slightly
heated, otherwise the cold china will
extract all the heat from the omelet.</p>


<h3>OMELETTE AUX CONFITURES,
or Jam Omelet.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 eggs, 4 oz. of butter,
3 tablespoonfuls of apricot, strawberry,
or any jam that may be preferred.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make an omelet, only instead
of doubling it over, leave it flat in the
pan. When quite firm, and nicely brown
on one side, turn it carefully on to a hot
dish, spread over the middle of it the
jam, and fold the omelet over on each
side; sprinkle sifted sugar over, and
serve very quickly. A pretty dish of
small omelets may be made by dividing
the batter into 3 or 4 portions, and frying
them separately; they should then be
spread each one with a different kind of
preserve, and the omelets rolled over.
Always sprinkle sweet omelets with
sifted sugar before being sent to table.
<i>Time.</i>—4 to 6 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>OMELET, Bachelor’s.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 or 3 eggs, 2 oz. of
butter,  teaspoonful of flour, ½ teacupful
of milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a thin cream of
the flour and milk; then beat up the
eggs, mix all together, and add a pinch
of salt and a few grains of cayenne.
Melt the butter in a small frying-pan,
and, when very hot, pour in the batter.
Let the pan remain for a few minutes
over a clear fire; then sprinkle upon the
omelet some chopped herbs and a few
shreds of onion; double the omelet dexterously,
and shake it out of the pan on
to a hot dish. A simple sweet omelet
can be made by the same process, substituting
sugar or preserve for the
chopped herbs. <i>Time.</i>—2 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 2 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>OMELET, Plain Sweet.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 eggs, 4 oz. of butter,
2 oz. of sifted sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Break the
eggs into a basin, omitting the whites
of 3; whisk them well, adding the sugar
and 2 oz. of the butter, which should
be broken into small pieces, and stir all
these ingredients well together. Make
the remainder of the butter quite hot in
a small frying-pan, and when it commences
to bubble, pour in the eggs, &amp;c.
Keep stirring them until they begin to
set; then turn the edges of the omelet
over, to make it an oval shape, and finish
cooking it. To brown the top, hold the
pan before the fire, or use a salamander,
and turn it carefully on to a <i>very hot</i>
dish; sprinkle sifted sugar over, and
serve. <i>Time.</i>—From 4 to 6 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>OMELETTE SOUFFLÉ.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 eggs, 5 oz. of pounded
sugar, flavouring of vanilla, orange-flower
water, or lemon-rind, 3 oz. of butter,
1 dessertspoonful of rice-flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Separate
the yolks from the whites of
the eggs, add to the former the sugar,
the rice-flour, and either of the above
flavourings that may be preferred, and
stir these ingredients well together.
Whip the whites of the eggs, mix them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
lightly with the batter, and put the
butter into a small frying-pan. As soon
as it begins to bubble, pour the batter
into it, and set the pan over a bright but
gentle fire; and when the omelet is set,
turn the edges over to make it an oval
shape, and slip it on to a silver dish,
which has been previously well buttered.
Put it in the oven, and bake from 12 to
15 minutes; sprinkle finely-powdered
sugar over the soufflé, and <i>serve it immediately.</i>
<i>Time.</i>—About 4 minutes in the
pan; to bake, from 12 to 15 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>ONION SAUCE, Brown.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 large onions, rather
more than ½ pint of good gravy, 2 oz. of
butter, salt and pepper to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice
and fry the onions of a pale
brown in a stewpan, with the above
quantity of butter, keeping them well
stirred, that they do not get black.
When a nice colour, pour over the gravy,
and let them simmer gently until tender.
Now skim off every particle of fat, add
the seasoning, and rub the whole through
a tammy or sieve; put it back into the
saucepan to warm, and when it boils,
serve. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether 1 hour. <i>Seasonable</i>
from August to March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Where a high flavouring is
liked, add 1 tablespoonful of mushroom
ketchup, or a small quantity of port
wine.</p>


<h3>ONION SAUCE, French, or Soubise.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of Béchamel,
1 bay-leaf, seasoning to taste of pounded
mace and cayenne, 6 onions, a small
piece of ham. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel the onions
and cut them in halves; put them into
a stewpan, with just sufficient water to
cover them, and add the bay-leaf, ham,
cayenne, and mace; be careful to keep
the lid closely shut, and simmer them
until tender. Take them out and drain
thoroughly; rub them through a tammy
or sieve (an old one does for the purpose)
with a wooden spoon, and put them to
½ pint of Béchamel; keep stirring over
the fire until it boils, when serve. If it
should require any more seasoning, add
it to taste. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour to boil the
onions. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> for this
quantity. <i>Sufficient</i> for a moderate-sized
dish.</p>


<h3>ONION SAUCE, White, for Boiled
Rabbits, Roast Shoulder of
Mutton, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—9 large onions, or 12 middling-sized
ones, 1 pint of melted butter
made with milk, ½ teaspoonful of salt, or
rather more. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel the onions
and put them into water to which a little
salt has been added, to preserve their
whiteness, and let them remain for ¼ hour.
Then put them into a stewpan, cover them
with water, and let them boil until tender,
and, if the onions should be very
strong, change the water after they have
been boiling for ¼ hour. Drain them
thoroughly, chop them, and rub them
through a tammy or sieve. Make 1 pint
of melted butter with milk, and when
that boils, put in the onions, with a
seasoning of salt; stir it till it simmers,
when it will be ready to serve. If these
directions are carefully attended to, this
onion sauce will be delicious. <i>Time.</i>—From
¾ to 1 hour, to boil the onions.
<i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per pint. <i>Sufficient</i> to
serve with a roast shoulder of mutton, or
boiled rabbit. <i>Seasonable</i> from August
to March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—To make this sauce very mild
and delicate, use Spanish onions, which
can be procured from the beginning of
September to Christmas. 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls
of cream added just before
serving, will be found to improve its
appearance very much. Small onions,
when very young, may be cooked whole,
and served in melted butter. A sieve or
tammy should be kept expressly for
onions; an old one answers the purpose,
as it is liable to retain the flavour and
smell, which of course would be excessively
disagreeable in delicate preparations.</p>


<h3>ONION SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 large onions, 2 oz. of
butter, salt and pepper to taste, ½ pint
of cream, 1 quart of stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Chop
the onions, put them in the butter,
stir them occasionally, but do not let
them brown. When tender, put the stock
to them, and season; strain the soup,
and add the boiling cream. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
in winter. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>


<h3>ONION SOUP, Cheap.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 middling-sized onions,
3 oz. of butter, a tablespoonful of rice-flour,
salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful
of powdered sugar, thickening
of butter and flour, 2 quarts of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut the onions small, put them
into the stewpan with the butter, and fry
them well; mix the rice-flour smoothly
with the water, add the onions, seasoning,
and sugar, and simmer till tender.
Thicken with butter and flour, and serve.
<i>Time.</i>—2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> per
quart. <i>Seasonable</i> in winter. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 8 persons.</p>


<h3>ONIONS, Burnt, for Gravies.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of onions, ½ pint of
water, ½ lb. of moist sugar, 1/3 pint of
vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel and chop the
onions fine, and put them into a stewpan
(not tinned), with the water; let them
boil for 5 minutes, then add the sugar,
and simmer gently until the mixture
becomes nearly black and throws out
bubbles of smoke. Have ready the
above proportion of boiling vinegar,
strain the liquor gradually to it, and
keep stirring with a wooden spoon until
it is well incorporated. When cold,
bottle for use. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 1
hour.</p>


<h3>ONIONS, Pickled (a very simple
Method, and exceedingly Good).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pickling onions; to each
quart of vinegar, 2 teaspoonfuls of allspice,
2 teaspoonfuls of whole black
pepper. <i>Mode.</i>—Have the onions
gathered when quite dry and ripe, and,
with the fingers, take off the thin outside
skin; then, with a silver knife (steel
should not be used, as it spoils the
colour of the onions), remove one more
skin, when the onion will look quite
clear. Have ready some very dry bottles
or jars, and as fast as they are peeled,
put them in. Pour over sufficient cold
vinegar to cover them, with pepper and
allspice in the above proportions, taking
care that each jar has its share of the
latter ingredients. Tie down with bladder,
and put them in a dry place, and in
a fortnight they will be fit for use. This
is a most simple recipe and very delicious,
the onions being nice and crisp.
They should be eaten within 6 or 8
months after being done, as the onions
are liable to become soft. <i>Seasonable</i>
from the middle of July to the end of
August.</p>


<h3><b>ONIONS, Pickled.</b></h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 gallon of pickling
onions, salt and water, milk; to each ½
gallon of vinegar, 1 oz. of bruised ginger,
¼ tablespoonful of cayenne, 1 oz. of allspice,
1 oz. of whole black pepper, ¼ oz.
of whole nutmeg bruised, 8 cloves, ¼ oz.
of mace. <i>Mode.</i>—Gather the onions,
which should not be too small, when they
are quite dry and ripe; wipe off the dirt,
but do not pare them; make a strong
solution of salt and water, into which put
the onions, and change this, morning and
night, for 3 days, and save the <i>last</i> brine
they were put in. Then take the outside
skin off, and put them into a tin saucepan
capable of holding them all, as they
are always better done together. Now
take equal quantities of milk and the last
salt and water the onions were in, and
pour this to them; to this add 2 large
spoonfuls of salt, put them over the fire,
and watch them very attentively. Keep
constantly turning the onions about with
a wooden skimmer, those at the bottom
to the top, and <i>vice versâ</i>; and let the
milk and water run through the holes of
the skimmer. Remember, the onions
must never boil, or, if they do, they will
be good for nothing; and they should be
quite transparent. Keep the onions
stirred for a few minutes, and, in stirring
them, be particular not to break them.
Then have ready a pan with a colander,
into which turn the onions to drain,
covering them with a cloth to keep in the
steam. Place on a table an old cloth, 2
or 3 times double; put the onions on it
when quite hot, and over them an old piece
of blanket; cover this closely over them,
to keep in the steam. Let them remain
till the next day, when they will be quite
cold, and look yellow and shrivelled; take
off the shrivelled skins, when they should
be as white as snow. Put them into a pan,
make a pickle of vinegar and the remaining
ingredients, boil all these up, and
pour hot over the onions in the pan.
Cover very closely to keep in all the
steam, and let them stand till the following
day, when they will be quite cold.
Put them into jars or bottles well bunged,
and a tablespoonful of the best olive-oil
on the top of each jar or bottle. Tie
them down with bladder, and let them
stand in a cool place for a month or six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
weeks, when they will be fit for use.
They should be beautifully white, and
eat crisp, without the least softness, and
will keep good many months. <i>Seasonable</i>
from the middle of July to the end of
August.</p>


<h3>ONIONS, Spanish, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 or 5 Spanish onions,
salt, and water. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the onions,
with their skins on, into a saucepan of
boiling water slightly salted, and let
them boil quickly for an hour. Then
take them out, wipe them thoroughly,
wrap each one in a piece of paper
separately, and bake them in a moderate
oven for 2 hours, or longer, should the
onions be very large. They may be
served in their skins, and eaten with a
piece of cold butter and a seasoning of
pepper and salt; or they may be peeled,
and a good brown gravy poured over
them. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour to boil, 2 hours to
bake. <i>Average cost</i>, medium-sized, 2<i>d.</i>
each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to January.</p>


<h3>ONIONS, Spanish, Pickled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Onions, vinegar; salt
and cayenne to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the
onions in thin slices; put a layer of them
in the bottom of a jar; sprinkle with salt
and cayenne; then add another layer of
onions, and season as before. Proceeding
in this manner till the jar is full, pour in
sufficient vinegar to cover the whole, and
the pickle will be fit for use in a month.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—May be had in England from
September to February.</p>


<h3>ONIONS, Spanish, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—5 or 6 Spanish onions, 1
pint of good broth or gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel
the onions, taking care not to cut
away too much of the tops or tails, or
they would then fall to pieces; put them
into a stewpan capable of holding them
at the bottom without piling them one on
the top of another; add the broth or
gravy, and simmer <i>very gently</i> until the
onions are perfectly tender. Dish them,
pour the gravy round, and serve. Instead
of using broth, Spanish onions may be
stewed with a large piece of butter: they
must be done very gradually over a slow
fire or hot-plate, and will produce plenty
of gravy. <i>Time.</i>—To stew in gravy, 2
hours, or longer if very large. <i>Average
cost</i>, medium-sized, 2<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to January.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Stewed Spanish onions are a
favourite accompaniment to roast shoulder
of mutton.</p>


<h3>ORANGE BRANDY. (Excellent.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every ½ gallon of
brandy allow ¾ pint of Seville orange-juice,
1¼ lb. of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—To bring out
the full flavour of the orange-peel, rub a
few lumps of the sugar on 2 or 3 unpared
oranges, and put these lumps to the
rest. Mix the brandy with the orange-juice,
strained, the rinds of 6 of the
oranges pared very thin, and the sugar.
Let all stand in a closely-covered jar for
about 3 days, stirring it 3 or 4 times a
day. When clear, it should be bottled
and closely corked for a year; it will
then be ready for use, but will keep any
length of time. This is a most excellent
stomachic when taken pure in small quantities;
or, as the strength of the brandy
is very little deteriorated by the other
ingredients, it may be diluted with
water. <i>Time.</i>—To be stirred every day
for 3 days. <i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
to make 2 quarts. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in March.</p>


<h3>ORANGE CREAM.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/illus-223.jpg" width="279" height="151" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">OPEN MOULD.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 oz. of isinglass, 6 large
oranges, 1 lemon, sugar to taste, water,
½ pint of good cream. <i>Mode.</i>—Squeeze
the juice from the oranges and lemon;
strain it, and put it into a saucepan
with the isinglass, and sufficient water
to make it in all 1½ pint. Rub the sugar
on the orange and lemon-rind, add it to
the other ingredients, and boil all together
for about 10 minutes. Strain
through a muslin bag, and, when cold,
beat up with it ½ pint of thick cream.
Wet a mould, or soak it in cold water;
pour in the cream, and put it in a cool
place to set. If the weather is very cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>

these quarters in a muslin bag in water
until they are quite soft, and they can
be pierced easily with the head of a pin;
then cut them into chips about 1 inch
long, and as thin as possible. Should
there be a great deal of white stringy
pulp, remove it before cutting the rind
into chips. Split open the oranges,
scrape out the best part of the pulp,
with the juice, rejecting the white pith
and pips. Make a syrup with the sugar
and water; boil it until clear; then put
in the chips, pulp, and juice, and boil

<h3>ORANGE WINE, a very Simple
and Easy Method of Making a
very Superior.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—90 Seville oranges, 32
lbs. of lump sugar, water. <i>Mode.</i>—Break
up the sugar into small pieces, and
put it into a dry, sweet, 9-gallon cask,
placed in a cellar or other storehouse,
where it is intended to be kept. Have
ready close to the cask two large pans or
wooden keelers, into one of which put
the peel of the oranges pared quite thin,
and into the other the pulp after the
juice has been squeezed from it. Strain
the juice through a piece of double muslin,
and put into the cask with the sugar.
Then pour about 1½ gallon of cold
spring water on both the peels and the
pulp; let it stand for 24 hours, and then
strain it into the cask; add more water
to the peels and pulp when this is done,
and repeat the same process every day
for a week: it should take about a week
to fill up the cask. Be careful to apportion
the quantity as nearly as possible
to the seven days, and to stir the contents
of the cask each day. On the <i>third</i> day
after the cask is full—that is, the <i>tenth</i>
day after the commencement of making—the
cask may be securely bunged down.
This is a very simple and easy method,
and the wine made according to it will
be pronounced to be most excellent.
There is no troublesome boiling, and all
fermentation takes place in the cask.
When the above directions are attended
to, the wine cannot fail to be good. It
should be bottled in 8 or 9 months, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
will be fit for use in a twelvemonth after
the time of making. Ginger wine may
be made in precisely the same manner,
only, with the 9-gallon cask for ginger
wine, 2 lbs. of the best whole ginger,
<i>bruised</i>, must be put with the sugar. It
will be found convenient to tie the ginger
loosely in a muslin bag. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
10 days to make it. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per gallon. <i>Sufficient</i> for 9
gallons.  <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this in
March, and bottle it in the following
January.</p>


<h3>ORANGES, Compôte of.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 251px;">
<img src="images/illus-227.jpg" width="251" height="83" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">COMPÔTE OF ORANGES.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of syrup, 6 oranges.
<i>Mode.</i>—Peel the oranges, remove as
much of the white pith as possible, and
divide them into small pieces without
breaking the thin skin with which they
are surrounded. Make the syrup by
recipe, adding the rind of the orange cut
into thin narrow strips. When the syrup
has been well skimmed, and is quite
clear, put in the pieces of orange, and
simmer them for 5 minutes. Take them
out carefully with a spoon without
breaking them, and arrange them on a
glass dish. Reduce the syrup by boiling
it quickly until thick; let it cool a little,
pour it over the oranges, and, when
cold, they will be ready for table. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes to boil the syrup; 5
minutes to simmer the oranges;
5 minutes to reduce the syrup. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from November to May.</p>


<h3>ORANGES, a Pretty Dish of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 large oranges, ½ lb. of
loaf sugar, ¼ pint of water, ½ pint of
cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of any kind of
liquor, sugar to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the
sugar and water into a saucepan, and
boil them until the sugar becomes brittle,
which may be ascertained by taking
up a small quantity in a spoon, and dipping
it in cold water; if the sugar is
sufficiently boiled, it will easily snap.
Peel the oranges, remove as much of the
white pith as possible, and divide them
into nice-sized slices, without breaking
the thin white skin which surrounds
the juicy pulp. Place the pieces of
orange on small skewers, dip them into
the hot sugar, and arrange them in
layers round a plain mould, which should
be well oiled with the purest salad-oil.
The sides of the mould only should be
lined with the oranges, and the centre
left open for the cream. Let the sugar
become firm by cooling; turn the
oranges carefully out on a dish, and fill
the centre with whipped cream, flavoured
with any kind of liqueur, and sweetened
with pounded sugar. This is an exceedingly
ornamental and nice dish for the
supper-table. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes to boil
the sugar. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>—<i>Sufficient</i>
for 1 mould. <i>Seasonable</i> from November
to May.</p>


<h3>ORANGES, Iced.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Oranges; to every lb. of
pounded loaf sugar allow the whites of 2
eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Whisk the whites of the
eggs well, stir in the sugar, and beat
this mixture for ¼ hour. Skin the
oranges, remove as much of the white
pith as possible without injuring the
pulp of the fruit; pass a thread through
the centre of each orange, dip them
into the sugar, and tie them to a stick.
Place this stick across the oven, and let
the oranges remain until dry, when they
will have the appearance of balls of ice.
They make a pretty dessert or supper
dish. Care must be taken not to have
the oven too fierce, or the oranges would
scorch and acquire a brown colour,
which would entirely spoil their appearance.
<i>Time.</i>—From ½ to 1 hour to dry
in a moderate oven. <i>Average cost</i>, 1½<i>d.</i>
each. <i>Sufficient.</i>—½ lb. of sugar to ice
12 oranges. <i>Seasonable</i> from November
to May.</p>


<h3>ORANGES, Preserved.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Oranges; to every lb. of
juice and pulp allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar;
to every pint of water ½ lb. of loaf sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wholly grate or peel the oranges,
taking off only the thin outside portion
of the rind. Make a small incision where
the stalk is taken out, squeeze out as
much of the juice as can be obtained,
and preserve it in a basin with the pulp
that accompanies it. Put the oranges
into cold water; let them stand for 3
days, changing the water twice; then
boil them in fresh water till they are
very tender, and put them to drain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Make a syrup with the above proportion
of sugar and water, sufficient to cover the
oranges; let them stand in it for 2 or 3
days; then drain them well. Weigh the
juice and pulp, allow double their weight
of sugar, and boil them together until
the scum ceases to rise, which must all
be carefully removed; put in the
oranges, boil them for 10 minutes, place
them in jars, pour over them the syrup,
and, when cold, cover down. They will
be fit for use in a week. <i>Time.</i>—3 days
for the oranges to remain in water, 3
days in the syrup; ½ hour to boil the
pulp, 10 minutes the oranges. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This
preserve should be made in
February or March, when oranges are
plentiful.</p>


<h3>OX, The.</h3>

<p>The manner in which a side of beef
is cut up in London is shown in the
engraving on this page. In the metropolis,
on account of the large number
of its population possessing the means to
indulge in the “best of everything,” the
demand for the most delicate joints of
meat is great, the price, at the same
time, being much higher for these than
for the other parts. The consequence is,
that in London the carcass is there divided
so as to obtain the greatest quantity
of meat on the most esteemed joints.
In many places, however, where, from
a greater equality in the social condition
and habits of the inhabitants, the demand
and prices for the different parts
of the carcasses are more equalized,
there is not the same reason for the
butcher to cut the best joints so large.</p>

<p>The meat on those parts of the animal
in which the muscles are least called into
action is most tender and succulent;
as, for instance, along the back, from
the rump to the hinder part of the
shoulder; whilst the limbs, shoulder,
and neck are the toughest, driest, and
least-esteemed.</p>

<p>The names of the several joints in the
hind and fore quarters of a side of beef,
and the purposes for which they are
used, are as follows:—</p>

JOINTS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Hind Quarter:</i>—</p>

<div class="hangsection">
<p>1. Sirloin,—the two sirloins, cut
together in one joint, form a
baron; this, when roasted, is
the famous national dish of Englishmen,
at entertainments, on
occasion of rejoicing.</p>

<p>2. Rump,—the finest part for steaks.</p>

<p>3. Aitchbone,—boiling piece.</p>

<p>4. Buttock,—prime boiling piece.</p>

<p>5. Mouse-round,—boiling or stewing.</p>

<p>6. Hock,—stewing.</p>

<p>7. Thick flank, cut with the udder-fat,—primest
boiling piece.</p>

<p>8. Thin flank,—boiling.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Fore Quarter:</i>—</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>9. Five ribs, called the fore-rib.—This
is considered the primest
roasting piece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>10. Four ribs, called the middle-rib,—greatly
esteemed by housekeepers
as the most economical
joint for roasting.</p>

<p>11. Two ribs, called the chuck-rib,—used
for second quality of
steaks.</p>

<p>12. Leg-of-mutton piece,—the muscles
of the shoulder dissected
from the breast.</p>

<p>13. Brisket, or breast,—used for
boiling, after being salted.</p>

<p>14. Neck, clod, and sticking-piece,—used
for soups, gravies, stocks,
pies, and mincing for sausages.</p>

<p>15. Shin,—stewing.</p></div>

<p>The following is a classification of the
qualities of meat, according to the several
joints of beef, when cut up in the
London manner.</p>

<p><i>First class</i>—includes the sirloin, with
the kidney suet (1), the rump-steak
piece (2), the fore-rib (9).</p>

according to the season. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—These may be more easily
prepared by putting the tails in a brisk
oven, after they have been dipped in
egg and bread-crumb; and, when brown,
they are done. They must be boiled the
same time as for broiling.</p>


<h3>OX-TAIL SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 ox-tails, 2 slices of
ham, 1 oz. of butter, 2 carrots, 2 turnips,

1½ oz. of chopped suet or butter, 1 faggot
of savoury herbs, ¼ saltspoonful of grated
nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 2 eggs,
18 oysters. <i>Mode.</i>—Grate the bread
very fine, and be careful that no large
lumps remain; put it into a basin with
the suet, which must be very finely
minced, or, when butter is used, that
must be cut up into small pieces. Add
the herbs, also chopped as small as possible,
and seasoning; mix all these well
together, until the ingredients are thoroughly
mingled. Open and beard the
oysters, chop them, but not too small,
and add them to the other ingredients.
Beat up the eggs, and, with the hand,
work altogether, until it is smoothly
mixed. The turkey should not be stuffed
too full: if there should be too much
forcemeat, roll it into balls, fry them,
and use them as a garnish. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 1 turkey.</p>


<h3>OYSTER KETCHUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sufficient oysters to fill

of salt, 1 drachm of cayenne, 2 drachms
of pounded mace. <i>Mode.</i>—Procure the
oysters very fresh, and open sufficient to
fill a pint measure; save the liquor, and
scald the oysters in it with the sherry;
strain the oysters, and put them in a
mortar with the salt, cayenne, and
mace; pound the whole until reduced to
a pulp, then add it to the liquor in which
they were scalded; boil it again five
minutes, and skim well; rub the whole
through a sieve, and, when cold, bottle
and cork closely. The corks should be
sealed. <i>Seasonable</i> from September to

<h3>OYSTER PATTIES (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 dozen oysters, 2 oz. of
butter, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
little lemon-juice, 1 blade of pounded
mace; cayenne to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Scald
the oysters in their own liquor, beard
them, and cut each one into 3 pieces.
Put the butter into a stewpan, dredge
in sufficient flour to dry it up; add the
strained oyster-liquor with the other
ingredients; put in the oysters, and let
them heat gradually, but not boil fast.
Make the patty-cases as directed for
lobster patties, fill with the oyster mixture,
and replace the covers. <i>Time.</i>—2
minutes for the oysters to simmer in the
mixture. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the
patty-cases, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from
September to April.</p>


<h3>OYSTER SAUCE, to serve with
Fish, Boiled Poultry, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 dozen oysters, ½ pint
of melted butter, made with milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Open
the oysters carefully, and save
their liquor; strain it into a clean
saucepan (a lined one is best), put in the
oysters, and let them just come to the
boiling-point, when they should look
plump. Take them off the fire immediately,
and put the whole into a basin.
Strain the liquor from them, mix with it
sufficient melted butter made with milk
to make ½ pint altogether. When this
is ready and very smooth, put in the
oysters, which should be previously
bearded, if you wish the sauce to be
really nice. Set it by the side of the
fire to get thoroughly hot, <i>but do not
allow it to boil</i>, or the oysters will immediately
harden. Using cream instead of
milk makes this sauce extremely delicious.
When liked, add a seasoning of cayenne
or anchovy sauce; but, as we have
before stated, a plain sauce <i>should</i> be plain,
and not be overpowered by highly-flavoured
essences; therefore we recommend
that the above directions be implicitly
followed, and no seasoning added.
<i>Average cost</i> for this quantity, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 persons. Never allow fewer
than 6 oysters to 1 person, unless the
party is very large. <i>Seasonable</i> from
September to April.</p>

<p>A more economical sauce may be
made by using a smaller quantity of
oysters, and not bearding them before
they are added to the sauce: this may
answer the purpose, but we cannot
undertake to recommend it as a mode
for making this delicious adjunct to
fish, &amp;c.</p>

minutes. <i>Average cost</i> for this quantity,
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from September to
April. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.</p>


<h3>OYSTERS Fried in Batter.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of oysters, 2 eggs,
½ pint of milk, sufficient flour to make
the batter; pepper and salt to taste;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>

<h3>OYSTERS, to Keep.</h3>

<p>Put them in a tub, and cover them
with salt and water. Let them remain
for 12 hours, when they are to be taken
out, and allowed to stand for another
12 hours without water. If left without
water every alternate 12 hours, they will
be much better than if constantly kept
in it. Never put the same water twice
to them.</p>


<h3>OYSTERS, Pickled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—100 oysters; to each
½ pint of vinegar, 1 blade of pounded
mace, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 12 black
peppercorns. <i>Mode.</i>—Get the oysters
in good condition, open them, place
them in a saucepan, and let them
simmer in their own liquor for about
10 minutes very gently; then take
them out one by one, and place
them in a jar, and cover them, when
cold, with a pickle made as follows:—Measure
the oyster-liquor; add
to it the same quantity of vinegar, with
mace, lemon-peel, and pepper in the
above proportion, and boil it for 5 minutes;
when cold, pour over the oysters,
and tie them down very closely, as contact
with the air spoils them. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to April.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Put this pickle away in small
jars; because, directly one is opened,
its contents should immediately be eaten,
as they soon spoil. The pickle should
not be kept more than 2 or 3 months.</p>


<h3>OYSTERS, Scalloped.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Oysters, say 1 pint, 1 oz.
butter, flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of white

when melted, dredge in sufficient flour
to dry it up; add the stock, cream, and
strained liquor, and give one boil. Put
in the oysters and seasoning; let them
gradually heat through, but not boil.
Have ready the scallop-shells buttered;
lay in the oysters, and as much of the
liquid as they will hold; cover them

drop a little oiled butter. Brown them
in the oven, or before the fire, and serve
quickly, and very hot. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
¼ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, for this
quantity, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons.</p>


<h3>OYSTERS, Scalloped.</h3>

<p>Prepare the oysters as in the preceding
recipe, and put them in a scallop-shell
or saucer, and between each layer sprinkle
over a few bread-crumbs, pepper, salt,
and grated nutmeg; place small pieces
of butter over, and bake before the fire
in a Dutch oven. Put sufficient bread-crumbs
on the top to make a smooth
surface, as the oysters should not be
seen. <i>Time.</i>—About ¼ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to April.</p>


<h3>OYSTERS, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of oysters, 1 oz.
of butter, flour, 1/3 pint of cream; cayenne
and salt to taste; 1 blade of pounded
mace. <i>Mode.</i>—Scald the oysters in their
own liquor, take them out, beard them,

not longer, or the oysters would harden.
Serve on a hot dish, and garnish with
croûtons, or toasted sippets of bread.
A small piece of lemon-peel boiled with
the oyster-liquor, and taken out before
the cream is added, will be found an
improvement. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether 15 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i> for this quantity,
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from September to
April. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>


<h3>PANCAKES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Eggs, flour, milk; to
every egg allow 1 oz. of flour, about 1
gill of milk, ⅛ saltspoonful of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Ascertain
that the eggs are fresh;
break each one separately in a cup;
whisk them well, put them into a basin,
with the flour, salt, and a few drops of
milk, and beat the whole to a perfectly
<i>smooth</i> batter; then add by degrees the
remainder of the milk. The proportion
of this latter ingredient must be regulated
by the size of the eggs, &amp;c. &amp;c.;
but the batter, when ready for frying,
should be of the consistency of thick
cream. Place a small frying-pan on the
fire to get
hot; let it
be delicately
clean,
or the
pancakes will
stick, and,
when quite hot, put into it a small
piece of butter, allowing about ½
oz. to each pancake. When it is melted,
pour in the batter, about ½ teacupful to
a pan 5 inches in diameter, and fry it for
about 4 minutes, or until it is nicely
brown on one side. By only pouring in
a small quantity of batter, and so making
the pancakes thin, the necessity of turning
them (an operation rather difficult to
unskilful cooks) is obviated. When the
pancake is done, sprinkle over it some
pounded sugar, roll it up in the pan, and
take it out with a large slice, and place
it on a dish before the fire. Proceed in
this manner until sufficient are cooked
for a dish; then send them quickly to
table, and continue to send in a further
quantity, as pancakes are never good
unless eaten almost immediately they
come from the frying-pan. The batter
may be flavoured with a little grated
lemon-rind, or the pancakes may have
preserve rolled in them instead of sugar.
Send sifted sugar and a cut lemon to
table with them. To render the pancakes
very light, the yolks and whites
of the eggs should be beaten separately,
and the whites added the last thing to
the batter before frying. <i>Time.</i>—From
4 to 5 minutes for a pancake that does
not require turning; from 6 to 8 minutes
for a thicker one. <i>Average cost</i> for 3
persons, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 3 eggs,
with the other ingredients in proportion,
for 3 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time,
but specially served on Shrove Tuesday.</p>

<h3>PARSLEY AND BUTTER, to
serve with Calf’s Head, Boiled
Fowls, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 tablespoonfuls of
minced parsley, ½ pint of melted butter.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put into a saucepan a small
quantity of water, slightly salted, and
when it boils, throw in a good bunch of
parsley which has been previously
washed and tied together in a bunch;
let it boil for 5 minutes, drain it, mince
the leaves <i>very fine</i>, and put the above
quantity in a tureen; pour over it ½ pint
of smoothly-made melted butter; stir
once, that the ingredients may be
thoroughly mixed, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—5
minutes to boil the parsley. <i>Average

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Parsley, hot lard or clarified
dripping. <i>Mode.</i>—Gather some
young parsley; wash, pick, and dry it
thoroughly in a cloth; put it into the
wire basket of which we have given an
engraving, and hold it in boiling lard or
dripping for a minute or two. Directly
it is done, lift out the basket, and let it
stand before the fire, that the parsley
may become thoroughly crisp; and the
quicker it is fried the better. Should
the kitchen not be furnished with the
above article, throw the parsley into the
frying-pan, and when crisp, lift it out
with a slice, dry it before the fire, and
when thoroughly crisp it will be ready
for use.</p>

<div class="caption">WIRE BASKET.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wire Basket.</span>—For this recipe a wire
basket, as shown in the annexed engraving,
will be found very useful. It is very
light and handy, and may be used for
other similar purposes besides that just
described.</p>


<h3>PARSLEY JUICE, for Colouring
various Dishes.</h3>

<p>Procure some nice young parsley;
wash it and dry it thoroughly in a cloth;
pound the leaves in a mortar till all the
juice is extracted, and put the juice in a
teacup or small jar; place this in a
saucepan of boiling water, and warm it
on the <i>bain-marie</i> principle just long
enough to take off its rawness; let it
drain, and it will be ready for colouring.</p>

<p><i>Substitute for.</i>—Sometimes in the
middle of winter parsley-leaves are not
to be had, when the following will be
found an excellent substitute:—Tie up
a little parsley-seed in a small piece of
muslin, and boil it for 10 minutes in a
small quantity of water; use this water
to make the melted butter with, and
throw into it a little boiled spinach,
minced rather fine, which will have an
appearance similar to that of parsley.</p>


<h3>PARSLEY, to Preserve through the
Winter.</h3>

<p>Use freshly-gathered parsley for keeping,
and wash it perfectly free from grit
and dirt; put it into boiling water which
has been slightly salted and well skimmed,
and then let it boil for 2 or 3 minutes;
take it out, let it drain, and lay it on a
sieve in front of the fire, when it should
be dried as expeditiously as possible.
Store it away in a very dry place in
bottles, and when wanted for use pour
over it a little warm water, and let it
stand for about 5 minutes. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This
may be done at any time between
June and October.</p>

<h3>PARSNIPS, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Parsnips; to each ½ gallon
of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful
of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the
parsnips, scrape them thoroughly, and
with the point of the knife remove any
black specks about them, and, should
they be very large, cut the thick part
into quarters. Put them into a saucepan
of boiling water salted in the above
proportion, boil them rapidly until tender,
which may be ascertained by thrusting a
fork in them; take them up, drain them,
and serve in a vegetable-dish. This
vegetable is usually served with salt fish,
boiled pork, or boiled beef: when sent
to table with the latter, a few should be
placed alternately with carrots round the
dish as a garnish. <i>Time.</i>—Large parsnips,
1 to 1½ hour; small ones, ½ to 1
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
1 for each person. <i>Seasonable</i>
from October to May.</p>


<h3>PARTRIDGE, Broiled (a Luncheon,
Breakfast, or Supper Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 partridges, salt and
cayenne to taste, a small piece of butter,
brown gravy or mushroom sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Pluck,
draw, and cut the partridges in
half, and wipe the inside thoroughly
with a damp cloth. Season them with
salt and cayenne, broil them over a very
clear fire, and dish them on a hot dish;
rub a small piece of butter over each
half, and send them to table with brown
gravy or mushroom sauce. <i>Time.</i>—About
¼ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
2<i>s.</i> a brace. <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or four persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from the 1st of September
to the beginning of February.</p>


<h3>PARTRIDGE PIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 partridges, pepper and
salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of minced
parsley (when obtainable, a few mushrooms),
¾ lb. of veal cutlet, a slice of
ham, ½ pint of stock, puff paste. <i>Mode.</i>—Line
a pie-dish with a veal cutlet;
over that place a slice of ham and a seasoning
of pepper and salt. Pluck, draw,
and wipe the partridges; cut off the legs
at the first joint, and season them inside
with pepper, salt, minced parsley, and a
small piece of butter; place them in the
dish, and pour over the stock; line the
edges of the dish with puff paste, cover with
the same, brush it over with the yolk of an
egg, and bake for ¾ to 1 hour. <i>Time.</i>—¾ to 1 hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>
a brace. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from the 1st of September to
the beginning of February.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Should the partridges be very
large, split them in half, they will then
lie in the dish more compactly. When
at hand, a few mushrooms should always
be added.</p>


<h3>PARTRIDGE, Potted.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Partridges; seasoning
to taste of mace, allspice, white pepper,
and salt; butter, coarse paste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pluck
and draw the birds, and wipe
them inside with a damp cloth. Pound
well some mace, allspice, white pepper,
and salt; mix together, and rub every
part of the partridges with this. Pack
the birds as closely as possible in a
baking-pan, with plenty of butter over
them, and cover with a coarse flour and
water crust. Tie a paper over this, and
bake for rather more than 1½ hour; let
the birds get cold, then cut them into
pieces for keeping, pack them closely
into a large potting-pot, and cover with
clarified butter. This should be kept in
a cool dry place. The butter used for
potted things will answer for basting, or
for paste for meat pies. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour.
<i>Seasonable</i> from the 1st of September to
the beginning of February.</p>


<h3>PARTRIDGE, Roast.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 251px;">
<img src="images/illus-235.jpg" width="251" height="90" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">ROAST PARTRIDGE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Partridge; butter.
<i>Choosing and Trussing.</i>—Choose young
birds, with dark-coloured bills and
yellowish legs, and let them hang a few
days, or there will be no flavour to the
flesh, nor will it be tender. The time
they should be kept entirely depends on
the taste of those for whom they are
intended, as what some persons would
consider delicious would be to others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
disgusting and offensive. They may be
trussed with or without the head, the
latter mode being now considered
the most fashionable. Pluck, draw,
and wipe the partridge carefully
inside and out; cut off the head, leaving
sufficient skin on the neck to skewer
back; bring the legs close to the breast,
between it and the side-bones, and pass
a skewer through the pinions and the
thick part of the thighs. When the head
is left on, it should be brought round
and fixed on to the point of the skewer.
<i>Mode.</i>—When the bird is firmly and
plumply trussed, roast it before a nice
bright fire; keep it well basted, and a
few minutes before serving, flour and
froth it well. Dish it, and serve with
gravy and bread sauce, and send to table
hot and quickly. A little of the gravy
should be poured over the bird. <i>Time.</i>—25
to 35 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
to 2<i>s.</i> a brace. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2 for a dish.
<i>Seasonable</i> from the 1st of September to
the beginning of February.</p>


<h3>PARTRIDGE SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 partridges, 3 slices of
lean ham, 2 shred onions, 1 head of
celery, 1 large carrot, and 1 turnip cut
into any fanciful shapes, 1 small lump of
sugar, 2 oz. of butter, salt and pepper to
taste, 2 quarts of medium stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the partridges into pieces, and
braise them in the butter and ham until
quite tender; then take out the legs,
wings, and breast, and set them by.
Keep the backs and other trimmings in
the braise, and add the onions and
celery; any remains of cold game can be
put in, and 3 pints of stock. Simmer
slowly for 1 hour, strain it, and skim the
fat off as clean as possible; put in the
pieces that were taken out, give it one
boil, and skim again to have it quite
clear, and add the sugar and seasoning.
Now simmer the cut carrot and turnip in
1 pint of stock; when quite tender, put
them to the partridges, and serve.
<i>Time.</i>—2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> or 1<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to February. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The meat of the partridges
may be pounded with a crumb of a
French roll, and worked with the soup
through a sieve. Serve with stewed
celery cut in slices, and put in the
tureen.</p>


<h3>PARTRIDGES, to Carve.</h3>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 214px;">
<img src="images/illus-236.jpg" width="214" height="205" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">ROAST PARTRIDGE.</div>
</div>
<p>There are several ways of carving this
most familiar game bird. The more
usual and summary
mode is to
carry the knife
sharply along
the top of the
breastbone of
the bird, and cut
it quite through,
thus dividing it
into two precisely
equal and
similar parts, in
the same manner
as carving a pigeon. Another plan is to
cut it into three pieces; viz., by severing
a small wing and leg on either side
from the body, by following the line
1 to 2 in the upper woodcut; thus
making 2 helpings, when the breast will
remain for a third plate. The most
elegant manner is that of thrusting back
the body from the legs, and then cutting
through the breast in the direction shown
by the line 1 to 2: this plan will give 4
or more small helpings. A little bread-sauce
should be served to each guest.</p>




<h3>PARTRIDGES, Hashed, or Salmi
de Perdrix.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 young partridges, 3
shallots, a slice of lean ham, 1 carrot, 3
or 4 mushrooms, a bunch of savoury
herbs, 2 cloves, 6 whole peppers, ¾ pint
of stock, 1 glass of sherry or Madeira,
a small lump of sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—After
the partridges are plucked and drawn,
roast them rather underdone, and cover
them with paper, as they should not be
browned; cut them into joints, take off
the skin from the wings, legs, and
breasts; put these into a stewpan, cover
them up, and set by until the gravy is
ready. Cut a slice of ham into small
pieces, and put them, with the carrots
sliced, the shallots, mushrooms, herbs,
cloves, and pepper, into a stewpan; fry
them lightly in a little butter, pour in
the stock, add the bones and trimming
from the partridges, and simmer for ¼
hour. Strain the gravy, let it cool, and
skim off every particle of fat; put it to
the legs, wings, and breasts, add a glass
of sherry or Madeira and a small lump
of sugar, let all gradually warm through
by the side of the fire, and when on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
point of boiling, serve, and garnish the
dish with croûtons. The remains of
roast partridge answer very well dressed
in this way, although not so good as
when the birds are in the first instance
only half-roasted. This recipe is equally
suitable for pheasants, moorgame, &amp;c.;
but care must be taken always to skin
the joints. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether 1 hour.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—2 or 3 partridges for an
entrée. <i>Seasonable</i> from the 1st of
September to the beginning of February.</p>


<h3><a id="PASTE_Common"></a>PASTE, Common, for Family Pies.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1¼ lb. of flour, ½ lb. of
butter, rather more than ½ pint of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Rub the butter lightly into the
flour, and mix it to a smooth paste with
the water; roll it out 2 or 3 times, and
it will be ready for use. This paste may
be converted into an excellent short
crust for sweet tart by adding to the
flour, after the butter is rubbed in, 2
tablespoonfuls of fine-sifted sugar. <i>Average
cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3><a id="PASTE_Puff"></a>PASTE, Puff, French, or Feuilletage
(Founded on M. Ude’s
Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Equal quantities of flour
and butter—say 1 lb. of each; ½ saltspoonful
of salt, the yolks of 2 eggs,
rather more than ¼ pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Weigh
the flour; ascertain that it is
perfectly <i>dry</i>, and sift it; squeeze all the
water from the butter, and wring it in a
clean cloth till there is no moisture remaining.
Put the flour on the paste-board,
work lightly into it 2 oz. of the
butter, and then make a hole in the
centre; into this well put the yolks of 2
eggs, the salt, and about ¼ pint of water
(the quantity of this latter ingredient
must be regulated by the cook, as it is
impossible to give the exact proportion
of it); knead up the paste quickly and
lightly, and, when quite smooth, roll it
out square to the thickness of about ½
inch. Presuming that the butter is perfectly
free from moisture, and <i>as cool</i> as
possible, roll it into a ball, and place this
ball of butter on the paste; fold the
paste over the butter all round, and
secure it by wrapping it well all over.
Flatten the paste by rolling it lightly
with the rolling-pin until it is quite thin,
but not thin enough to allow the butter
to break through, and keep the board
and paste dredged lightly with flour
during the process of making it. This
rolling gives it the <i>first</i> turn. Now fold
the paste in three, and roll out again,
and, should the weather be very warm,
put it in a cold place on the ground to
cool between the several turns; for,
unless this is particularly attended to,
the paste will be spoiled. Roll out the
paste again <i>twice</i>, put it by to cool, then
roll it out <i>twice</i> more, which will make 6
<i>turnings</i> in all. Now fold the paste in
two, and it will be ready for use. If
properly baked and well made, this crust
will be delicious, and should rise in the
oven about 5 or 6 inches. The paste should
be made rather firm in the first instance,
as the ball of butter is liable to break
through. Great attention must also be
paid to keeping the butter very cool, as,
if this is in a liquid and soft state, the
paste will not answer at all. Should the
cook be dexterous enough to succeed in
making this, the paste will have a much
better appearance than that made by the
process of dividing the butter into 4
parts, and placing it over the rolled-out
paste; but until experience has been
acquired, we recommend puff-paste made
by recipe. The above paste is used for
vols-au-vent, small articles of pastry,
and, in fact, everything that requires
very light crust. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per lb.</p>


<h3>PASTE, Puff, very Good.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour
allow 1 lb. of butter, and not quite ½ pint
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Carefully weigh the
flour and butter, and have the exact
proportion; squeeze the butter well, to
extract the water from it, and afterwards
wring it in a clean cloth, that no moisture
may remain. Sift the flour; see that it
is perfectly dry, and proceed in the
following manner to make the paste,
using a very <i>clean</i> paste-board and rolling-pin:—Supposing
the quantity to be 1 lb.
of flour, work the whole into a smooth
paste with not quite ½ pint of water,
using a knife to mix it with: the proportion
of this latter ingredient must be
regulated by the discretion of the cook;
if too much be added, the paste, when
baked, will be tough. Roll it out until
it is of an equal thickness of about an
inch; break 4 oz. of the butter into small
pieces; place these on the paste, sift over
it a little flour, fold it over, roll out again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and put another 4 oz. of butter. Repeat
the rolling and buttering until the paste
has been rolled out 4 times, or equal
quantities of flour and butter have been
used. Do not omit, every time the paste
is rolled out, to dredge a little flour over
that and the rolling-pin, to prevent both
from sticking. Handle the paste as
lightly as possible, and do not press
heavily upon it with the rolling-pin. The
next thing to be considered is the oven,
as the baking of pastry requires particular
attention. Do not put it into the oven
until it is sufficiently hot to raise the
paste; for the best-prepared paste, if not
properly baked, will be good for nothing.
Brushing the paste as often as rolled out,
and the pieces of butter placed thereon,
with the white of an egg, assists it to rise
in <i>leaves</i> or <i>flakes</i>. As this is the great
beauty of puff-paste, it is as well to try
this method. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3>PASTE, Puff, Medium.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour
allow 8 oz. of butter, 4 oz. of lard, not
quite ½ pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—This paste
may be made by the directions in the
preceding recipe, only using less butter,
and substituting lard for a portion of it.
Mix the flour to a smooth paste with
not quite ½ pint of water; then roll it
out 3 times, the first time covering the
paste with butter, the second with lard,
and the third with butter. Keep the
rolling-pin and paste slightly dredged
with flour, to prevent them from sticking,
and it will be ready for use. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3>PASTE, Puff (Soyer’s Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour
allow the yolk of 1 egg, the juice of 1
lemon, ½ saltspoonful of salt, cold water,
1 lb. of fresh butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the
flour on to the paste-board; make a hole
in the centre, into which put the yolk of
the egg, the lemon-juice, and salt; mix
the whole with cold water (this should
be iced in summer, if convenient) into a
soft flexible paste, with the right hand,
and handle it as little as possible; then
squeeze all the buttermilk from the
butter, wring it in a cloth, and roll out
the paste; place the butter on this, and
fold the edges of the paste over, so as to
hide it; roll it out again to the thickness
of ¼ inch; fold over one third, over
which again pass the rolling-pin; then
fold over the other third, thus forming a
square; place it with the ends, top, and
bottom before you, shaking a little flour
both under and over, and repeat the rolls
and turns twice again, as before. Flour
a baking-sheet, put the paste on this,
and let it remain on ice or in some cool
place for ½ hour; then roll twice more,
turning it as before; place it again upon
the ice for ¼ hour, give it 2 more rolls,
making 7 in all, and it is ready for use
when required. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per lb.</p>


<h3>PASTRY AND PUDDINGS,
Directions in connection with
the making of.</h3>

<p>A few general remarks respecting the
various ingredients of which puddings
and pastry are composed may be acceptable,
in addition to the recipes in this
department of Household Management.</p>

<p><i>Flour</i> should be of the best quality,
and perfectly dry, and sifted before
being used; if in the least damp, the
paste made from it will certainly be
heavy.</p>

<p><i>Butter</i>, unless fresh is used, should be
washed from the salt, and well squeezed
and wrung in a cloth, to get out all the
water and buttermilk, which, if left in,
assist to make the paste heavy.</p>

<p><i>Lard</i> should be perfectly sweet, which
may be ascertained by cutting the
bladder through, and, if the knife smells
sweet, the lard is good.</p>

<p><i>Suet</i> should be finely chopped, perfectly
free from skin, and quite sweet; during
the process of chopping, it should be
lightly dredged with flour, which prevents
the pieces from sticking together. Beef
suet is considered the best; but veal
suet, or the outside fat of a loin or neck
of mutton, makes good crusts; as also
the skimmings in which a joint of mutton
has been boiled, but <i>without</i> vegetables.</p>

<p><i>Clarified Beef Dripping</i> answers very
well for kitchen pies, puddings, cakes, or
for family use. A very good short crust
may be made by mixing with it a small
quantity of moist sugar; but care must
be taken to use the dripping sparingly,
or a very disagreeable flavour will be
imparted to the paste.</p>

<p>Strict cleanliness must be observed in
pastry-making; all the utensils used
should be perfectly free from dust and
dirt, and the things required for pastry
kept entirely for that purpose.</p>

<div class="caption">PASTE-BOARD AND ROLLING-PIN.</div>
</div>

<p>In mixing paste, add the water very
gradually, work the whole together with
the knife-blade, and knead it until
perfectly smooth. Those who are inexperienced
in pastry-making should work
the butter in by breaking it in small
pieces, and covering the paste rolled out.
It should then be dredged with flour,
and the ends folded over and rolled out
very thin again: this process must be
repeated until all the butter is used.</p>

<div class="caption">PASTE-PINCERS AND JAGGER, FOR
ORNAMENTING THE EDGES OF PIE-CRUSTS.</div>
</div>

<p>The art of making paste requires much
practice, dexterity, and skill: it should
be touched as lightly as possible, made
with cool hands and in a cool place (a
marble slab is better than a board for
the purpose), and the coolest part of the
house should be selected for the process
during warm weather.</p>

<div class="caption">PASTE-CUTTER AND CORNER-CUTTER.</div>
</div>

<p>To insure rich paste being light, great
expedition must be used in the making
and baking; for if it stand long before
it is put in the oven, it becomes flat and
heavy.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Puff-paste</i> requires a brisk oven, but
not too hot, or it would blacken the crust;
on the other hand, if the oven be too
slack, the paste will be soddened, and
will not rise, nor will it have any
colour.</p>

<p>Tart-tins, cake-moulds, dishes for baked
puddings, patty-pans, &amp;c., should all be
buttered before the article intended to
be baked is put in them. Things to be
baked on sheets should be placed on
buttered paper. Raised-pie paste should
have a soaking heat, and paste glazed
must have rather a slack oven, that
the icing be not scorched. It is
better to ice tarts, &amp;c., when they are
three-parts baked.</p>

<p>To ascertain when the oven is heated
to the proper degree for puff-paste, put
a small piece of the paste in previous to
baking the whole, and then the heat can
thus be judged of.</p>

<p>The freshness of all pudding ingredients
is of much importance, as one bad
article will taint the whole mixture.</p>

<p>When the <i>freshness</i> of eggs is <i>doubtful</i>,
break each one separately in a cup,
before mixing them altogether. Should
there be a bad one amongst them, it can
be thrown away; whereas, if mixed with
the good ones, the entire quantity would
be spoiled. The yolks and whites
beaten separately make the articles they
are put into much lighter.</p>

<p>Raisins and dried fruits for puddings
should be carefully picked, and in many
cases stoned. Currants should be well
washed, pressed in a cloth, and placed
on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly
dry: they should then be picked carefully
over, and <i>every piece of grit or stone</i>
removed from amongst them. To plump
them, some cooks pour boiling water
over them, and then dry them before the
fire.</p>

<div class="caption">BOILED-PUDDING MOULD.</div>
</div>

<p>Batter pudding should be smoothly
mixed and free from lumps. To insure
this, first mix the flour with a very small
proportion of milk, and add the remainder
by degrees. Should the pudding be
very lumpy, it may be strained through
a hair sieve.</p>

<p><i>All boiled puddings</i> should be put on
in <i>boiling water</i>, which must not be
allowed to stop
simmering, and
the pudding
must always be
covered with the
water; if requisite,
the saucepan
should be
kept filled up.</p>


<p>To prevent a
pudding boiled
in a cloth from
sticking to the
bottom of the
saucepan, place a small plate or saucer
underneath it, and set the pan <i>on a
trivet</i> over the fire. If a mould is used,
this precaution is not necessary; but
care must be taken to keep the pudding
well covered with water.</p>

<p>For dishing a boiled pudding as soon
as it comes out of the pot, dip it into a
basin of cold water, and the cloth will
then not adhere to it. Great expedition
is necessary in sending puddings to table,
as by standing they quickly become
heavy, batter puddings particularly.</p>

<div class="caption">PUDDING-BASIN.</div>
</div>

<p>Scrupulous attention should be paid
to the cleanliness of pudding-cloths, as
from neglect in this particular the outsides
of boiled puddings frequently taste
very disagreeably. As soon as possible
after it is taken off the pudding, it
should be soaked in water, and then well
washed, without soap, unless it be very
greasy. It should be dried out of doors,
then folded up and kept in a dry place.
When wanted for use, dip it in boiling
water, and dredge it slightly with flour.</p>

<p><i>The dry ingredients</i> for puddings are
better for being mixed some time before
they are wanted; the liquid portion
should only be added just before the
pudding is put into the saucepan.</p>

<p>A pinch of salt is an improvement to
the generality of puddings; but this
ingredient should be added very sparingly,
as the flavour should not be
detected.</p>

<p>When baked puddings are sufficiently
solid, turn them out of the dish they
were baked in, bottom uppermost, and
strew over them fine-sifted sugar.</p>

<p>When pastry or baked puddings are
not done through, and yet the outside is
sufficiently brown, cover them over with
a piece of white paper until thoroughly
cooked: this prevents them from getting
burnt.</p>

<h3>PASTRY, to Ice or Glaze.</h3>

<p>To glaze pastry, which is the usual
method adopted for meat or raised pies,
break an egg, separate the yolk from the
white, and beat the former for a short
time. Then, when the pastry is nearly
baked, take it out of the oven, brush it
over with this beaten yolk of egg, and
put it back in the oven to set the glaze.</p>

<p>To ice pastry, which is the usual
method adopted for fruit tarts and sweet
dishes of pastry, put the white of an egg
on a plate, and with the blade of a knife
beat it to a stiff froth. When the pastry
is nearly baked, brush it over with this,
and sift over some pounded sugar; put
it back into the oven to set the glaze,
and, in a few minutes, it will be done.
Great care should be taken that the
paste does not catch or burn in the oven,
which it is very liable to do after the
icing is laid on. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1 egg
and 1½ oz. of sugar to glaze 3 tarts.</p>


<h3>PASTRY SANDWICHES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Puff-paste, jam of any
kind, the white of an egg, sifted sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Roll the paste out thin; put half
of it on a baking-sheet or tin, and spread
equally over it apricot, greengage, or any
preserve that may be preferred. Lay
over this preserve another thin paste;
press the edges together all round; and
mark the paste in lines with a knife on
the surface, to show where to cut it when
baked. Bake from 20 minutes to ½ hour;
and, a short time before being done,
take the pastry out of the oven, brush it
over with the white of an egg, sift over
pounded sugar, and put it back in the
oven to colour. When cold, cut it into
strips; pile these on a dish pyramidically,
and serve. These strips, cut about 2
inches long, piled in circular rows, and
a plateful of flavoured whipped cream
poured in the middle, make a very pretty
dish. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to ½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, with ½ lb. of paste, 1<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient.</i>—½ lb. of paste will make 2
dishes of sandwiches. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>PATE BRISEE, Crust French, for
Raised Pies.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour allow
½ saltspoonful of salt, 2 eggs, 1/3 pint of
water, 6 oz. of butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Spread
the flour, which should be sifted and
thoroughly dry, on the paste-board;
make a hole in the centre, into which
put the butter; work it lightly into the
flour, and when quite fine, add the salt;
work the whole into a smooth paste with
the eggs (yolks and whites) and water,
and make it very firm. Knead the paste
well, and let it be rather stiff, that the
sides of the pie may be easily raised, and
that they do not afterwards tumble or
shrink. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per lb.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This paste may be very much
enriched by making it with equal quantities
of flour and butter; but then it
is not so easily raised as when made
plainer.</p>


<h3>PATTIES, Fried.</h3>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Cold Meat Cookery.</span>] <i>Ingredients.</i>—Cold
roast veal, a few slices of cold ham,

and chopped, and a seasoning of pounded
mace, salt, pepper, and lemon-peel;
moisten with a little gravy and cream.
Make a good puff-paste; roll rather thin,
and cut it into round or square pieces;
put the mince between two of them,
pinch the edges to keep in the gravy,
and fry a light brown. They may also
be baked in patty-pans; in that case,
they should be brushed over with the
yolk of an egg before they are put in the
oven. To make a variety, oysters may
be substituted for the ham. <i>Time.</i>—15
minutes to fry the patties. <i>Seasonable</i>
from March to October.</p>

peas are not quite young, a little more
sugar. Where economy is essential,
water may be used instead of stock for
this soup, boiling in it likewise the pea-shells;
but using a double quantity of
vegetables.</p>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of syrup, about
15 small peaches, <i>Mode.</i>—Peaches that
are not very large, and that would not
look well for dessert, answer very nicely
for a compôte. Divide the peaches, take
out the stones, and pare the fruit; make
a syrup by recipe, put in the peaches,
and stew them gently for about 10 minutes.
Take them out without breaking,
arrange them on a glass dish, boil the

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit
weighed before being stoned, allow ¼ lb.
of finely-pounded loaf sugar; brandy.
<i>Mode.</i>—Let the fruit be gathered in dry
weather; wipe and weigh it, and remove
the stones as carefully as possible, without
injuring the peaches much. Put
them into a jar, sprinkle amongst them
pounded loaf sugar in the above proportion,
and pour brandy over the fruit.
Cover the jar down closely, place it in a
saucepan of boiling water over the fire,
and bring the brandy to the simmering-point,
but do not allow it to boil. Take
the fruit out carefully, without breaking
it; put it into small jars, pour over it
the brandy, and, when cold, exclude the
air by covering the jars with bladders,
or tissue-paper brushed over on both
sides with the white of an egg. Apricots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>

<h3>PEARS, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 pears, the rind of 1
lemon, 6 cloves, 10 whole allspice; to
every pint of water allow ½ lb. of loaf
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare and cut the pears
into halves, and, should they be very
large, into quarters; leave the stalks on,
and carefully remove the cores. Place
them in a clean baking-jar, with a
closely-fitting lid; add to them the
lemon-rind cut in strips, the juice of ½
lemon, the cloves, pounded allspice, and
sufficient water just to cover the whole,
with sugar in the above proportion.
Cover the jar down closely, put it into
a very cool oven, and bake the pears
from 5 to 6 hours, but be very careful
that the oven is not too hot. To improve
the colour of the fruit, a few drops of
prepared cochineal may be added; but
this will not be found necessary, if the
pears are very gently baked. <i>Time.</i>—Large

preferred, and steep them in cold water
to prevent them turning black; put
them into a saucepan with sufficient cold
water to cover them, and boil them with
the butter and enough sugar to sweeten
them nicely, until tender; then brush
the pears over with the yolk of an egg,
sprinkle them with sifted sugar, and
arrange them on a dish. Add the gelatine
to the syrup, boil it up quickly for
about 5 minutes, strain it over the pears,
and let it remain until set. The syrup
may be coloured with a little prepared
cochineal, which would very much improve
the appearance of the dish. <i>Time.</i>—From
20 minutes to ½ hour to stew the
pears; 5 minutes to boil the syrup.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a large

small piece of cinnamon, ¼ pint of raisin
wine, a strip of lemon-peel, the juice of
½ lemon, ½ oz. of gelatine. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel
and cut the pears into quarters; put
them into a jar with ¾ pint of water,
cloves, cinnamon, and sufficient sugar to
sweeten the whole nicely; cover down
the top of the jar, and bake the pears in
a gentle oven until perfectly tender, but
do not allow them to break. When
done, lay the pears in a plain mould,
which should be well wetted, and boil
½ pint of the liquor the pears were baked
in with the wine, lemon-peel, strained
juice, and gelatine. Let these ingredients
boil quickly for 5 minutes, then
strain the liquid warm over the pears;
put the mould in a cool place, and when
the jelly is firm, turn it out on a glass
dish. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours to bake the pears
in a cool oven. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for a quart mould. <i>Seasonable</i>
from August to February.</p>


<h3>PEARS, Preserved.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Jargonelle pears; to
every lb. of sugar allow ½ pint of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Procure some Jargonelle pears,
not too ripe; put them into a stewpan
with sufficient water to cover them, and
simmer them till rather tender, but do
not allow them to break; then put them
into cold water. Boil the sugar and
water together for 5 minutes, skim well,
put in the pears, and simmer them
gently for 5 minutes. Repeat the simmering
for 3 successive days, taking
care not to let the fruit break. The last
time of boiling, the syrup should be
made rather richer, and the fruit boiled
for 10 minutes. When the pears are
done, drain them from the syrup, and
dry them in the sun, or in a cool oven;
or they may be kept in the syrup, and
dried as they are wanted. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour to simmer the pears in water, 20
minutes in the syrup. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i>

pint of water, ¼ pint of port wine, a few
drops of prepared cochineal. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the pears, halve them, remove the
cores, and leave the stalks on; put them
into a <i>lined</i> saucepan with the above
ingredients, and let them simmer very
gently until tender, which will be in
from 3 to 4 hours, according to the quality
of the pears. They should be
watched, and, when done, carefully lifted
out on to a glass dish without breaking
them. Boil up the syrup quickly for 2
or 3 minutes; allow it to cool a little,
pour it over the pears, and let them get
perfectly cold. To improve the colour
of the fruit, a few drops of prepared
cochineal may be added, which rather
enhances the beauty of this dish. The
fruit must not be boiled fast, but only
simmered, and watched that it be not
too much done. <i>Time.</i>—3 to 4 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or
6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to January.</p>

<h3>PEAS, Boiled Green.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Green peas; to each ½
gallon of water allow 1 <i>small</i> teaspoonful
of moist sugar, 1 heaped tablespoonful of
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—This delicious vegetable,
to be eaten in perfection, should be
young, and not <i>gathered</i> or <i>shelled</i> long
before it is dressed. Shell the peas, wash
them well in cold water, and drain them;
then put them into a saucepan with
plenty of <i>fast-boiling</i> water, to which
salt and <i>moist sugar</i> have been added in
the above proportion; let them boil
quickly over a brisk fire, with the lid of
the saucepan uncovered, and be careful
that the smoke does not draw in. When
tender, pour them into a colander; put
them into a hot vegetable-dish, and
quite in the centre of the peas place a
piece of butter, the size of a walnut.
Many cooks boil a small bunch of mint
<i>with</i> the <i>peas</i>, or garnish them with it,
by boiling a few sprigs in a saucepan by
themselves. Should the peas be very
old, and difficult to boil a good colour, a
very tiny piece of soda may be thrown
in the water previous to putting them
in; but this must be very sparingly
used, as it causes the peas, when boiled,
to have a smashed and broken appearance.
With young peas, there is not
the slightest occasion to use it. <i>Time.</i>—Young
peas, 10 to 15 minutes; the large
sorts, such as marrowfats, &amp;c., 18 to 24
minutes; old peas, ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
when cheapest, 6<i>d.</i> per peck; when first in
season, 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per peck. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
1 peck of unshelled peas

3 oz. of fresh butter, a bunch of parsley,
6 green onions, flour, a small lump of
sugar, ½ teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful
of flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Shell sufficient
fresh-gathered peas to fill 2 quarts; put
them into cold water, with the above
proportion of butter, and stir them about
until they are well covered with the
butter; drain them in a colander, and
put them in a stewpan, with the parsley
and onions; dredge over them a little
flour, stir the peas well, and moisten
them with boiling water; boil them
quickly over a large fire for 20 minutes,
or until there is no liquor remaining.
Dip a small lump of sugar into some
water, that it may soon melt; put it
with the peas, to which add ½ teaspoonful
of salt. Take a piece of butter the size
of a walnut, work it together with a teaspoonful
of flour, and add this to the
peas, which should be boiling when it is
put in. Keep shaking the stewpan, and,
when the peas are nicely thickened,
dress them high in the dish, and serve.
<i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ¾ hour. <i>Average

very gently for rather more than 1 hour;
then stir in a well-beaten egg, and
about ½ teaspoonful of powdered sugar.
When the peas, &amp;c., are nicely thickened,
serve; but, after the egg is added, do
not allow them to boil. <i>Time.</i>—1¼ hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> per peck. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 3 or 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from June
to the end of August.</p>

and take out the gills, and clean them
thoroughly; lay them in a stewpan with
sufficient stock and sherry just to cover
them. Put in the bay-leaf, garlic, parsley,
cloves, and salt, and simmer till
tender. When done, take out the fish,

<h3>PHEASANT.</h3>

<p>If this bird be eaten three days after
it has been killed, it then has no peculiarity
of flavour; a pullet would be more
relished, and a quail would surpass it in
aroma. Kept, however, a proper length
of time,—and this can be ascertained by
a slight smell and change of colour,—then
it becomes a highly-flavoured dish,
occupying, so to speak, the middle distance
between chicken and venison. It
is difficult to define any exact time to
“hang” a pheasant; but any one possessed
of the instincts of gastronomical
science, can at once detect the right
moment when a pheasant should be taken
down, in the same way as a good cook
knows whether a bird should be removed
from the spit, or have a turn or two
more.</p>


<h3>PHEASANT, Broiled (a Breakfast
or Luncheon Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pheasant, a little lard,
egg and bread-crumbs, salt and cayenne
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the legs off at the
first joint, and the remainder of the bird
into neat pieces; put them into a frying-pan
with a little lard, and when browned
on both sides, and about half done, take
them out and drain them; brush the
pieces over with egg, and sprinkle with
bread-crumbs with which has been mixed
a good seasoning of cayenne and salt.
Broil them over a moderate fire for about
10 minutes, or rather longer, and serve
with mushroom-sauce, sauce piquante,
or brown gravy, in which a few game-bones
and trimmings have been stewed.
<i>Time.</i>—Altogether ½ hour. <i>Sufficient</i> for
4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from the 1st
of October to the beginning of February.</p>


<h3>PHEASANT, to Carve.</h3>

<p>Fixing the fork in the breast, let the
carver cut slices from it in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of the lines from 2 to 1: these are the
prime pieces. If there be more guests
to satisfy than these slices will serve,
then let the legs and wings be disengaged
in the same manner as described
in carving boiled fowl, the point where
the wing joins the neckbone being carefully
found. The merrythought will
come off in the same way as that of a
fowl. The most valued parts are the
same as those which are most considered
in a fowl.</p>

<h3>PHEASANT CUTLETS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 or 3 pheasants, egg
and bread-crumbs, cayenne and salt to
taste, brown gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Procure 3
young pheasants that have been hung a
few days; pluck, draw, and wipe them
inside; cut them into joints; remove
the bones from the best of these; and
the backbones, trimmings, &amp;c., put into
a stewpan, with a little stock, herbs,
vegetables, seasoning, &amp;c., to make the
gravy. Flatten and trim the cutlets of
a good shape, egg and bread-crumb
them, broil them over a clear fire, pile
them high in the dish, and pour under
them the gravy made from the bones,
which should be strained, flavoured, and
thickened. One of the small bones
should be stuck on the point of each
cutlet. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 2
entrées. <i>Seasonable</i> from the 1st of
October to the beginning of February.</p>


<h3>PHEASANT, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pheasant, flour, butter.
<i>Choosing and trussing.</i>—Old pheasants
may be known by the length and sharpness
of their spurs; in young ones they
are short and blunt. The cock bird is
generally reckoned the best, except
when the hen is with egg. They should
hang some time before they are dressed,
as, if they are cooked fresh, the flesh
will be exceedingly dry and tasteless.
After the bird is plucked and drawn,
wipe the inside with a damp cloth, and
truss it in the same manner as partridge.
If the head is left on, as shown in the
engraving, bring it round under the
wing, and fix it on to the point of the
skewer. <i>Mode.</i>—Roast it before a brisk
fire, keep it well basted, and flour and
froth it nicely. Serve with brown gravy,
a little of which should be poured round
the bird, and a tureen of bread sauce.
2 or 3 of the pheasant’s best tail-feathers
are sometimes stuck in the tail as an
ornament; but the fashion is not much
to be commended. <i>Time.</i>—½ to 1 hour,
according to the size. <i>Average cost</i>,
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>,—1 for a
dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from the 1st of October
to the beginning of February.</p>

<h3>PHEASANT, Roast, Brillat Savarin’s
Recipe (à la Sainte Alliance).</h3>

<p>When the pheasant is in good condition
to be cooked, it should be plucked,
and not before. The bird should then
be stuffed in the following manner:—Take
two snipes, and draw them, putting
the bodies on one plate, and the livers,
&amp;c., on another. Take off the flesh, and
mince it finely with a little beef, lard, a
few truffles, pepper and salt to taste, and
stuff the pheasant carefully with this.
Cut a slice of bread, larger considerably
than the bird, and cover it with the liver,
&amp;c., and a few truffles: an anchovy and
a little fresh butter added to these will
do no harm. Put the bread, &amp;c., into
the dripping-pan, and, when the bird is
roasted, place it on the preparation, and
surround it with Florida oranges.</p>

<p>Do not be uneasy, Savarin adds, about
your dinner; for a pheasant served in
this way is fit for beings better than
men. The pheasant itself is a very good
bird; and, imbibing the dressing and
the flavour of the truffle and snipe, it
becomes thrice better.</p>


<h3>PHEASANT SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 pheasants, ¼ lb. of butter,
2 slices of ham, 2 large onions sliced,
½ head of celery, the crumb of two
French rolls, the yolks of 2 eggs boiled
hard; salt and cayenne to taste, a litt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>le
pounded mace, if liked; 3 quarts of
stock medium. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the
pheasants, flour and braise them in the
butter and ham till they are of a nice
brown, but not burnt. Put them in a
stewpan, with the onions, celery, stock,
and seasoning, and simmer for 2 hours.
Strain the soup; pound the breasts with
the crumb of the roll previously soaked,
and the yolks of the eggs; put it to the
soup, give one boil, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—2½
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> per
quart, or, if made with fragments of
cold game, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from October
to February. <i>Sufficient</i> for 10 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Fragments, pieces and bones of
cold game, may be used to great advantage
in this soup, and then 1 pheasant
will suffice.</p>


<h3>PICKLE, an Excellent.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Equal quantities of medium-sized
onions, cucumbers, and sauce-apples;
1½ teaspoonful of salt, ¾ teaspoonful
of cayenne, 1 wineglassful of soy, 1
wineglassful of sherry; vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice
sufficient cucumbers, onions, and
apples to fill a pint stone jar, taking care
to cut the slices very thin; arrange them
in alternate layers, adding at the same
time salt and cayenne in the above proportion;
pour in the soy and wine, and
fill up with vinegar. It will be fit for
use the day it is made. <i>Seasonable</i> in
August and September,</p>


<h3>PICKLE, Indian (very Superior).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each gallon of vinegar
allow 6 cloves of garlic, 12 shalots, 2
sticks of sliced horseradish, ¼ lb. of
bruised ginger, 2 oz. of whole black
pepper, 1 oz. of long pepper, 1 oz. of
allspice, 12 cloves, ¼ oz. of cayenne, 2
oz. of mustard-seed, ¼ lb. of mustard, 1
oz. of turmeric; a white cabbage, cauliflowers,
radish-pods, French beans, gherkins,
small round pickling-onions, nasturtiums,
capsicums, chilies, &amp;c. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the cabbage, which must be hard
and white, into slices, and the cauliflowers
into small branches; sprinkle
salt over them in a large dish, and let
them remain two days; then dry them,
and put them into a very large jar, with
garlic, shalots, horseradish, ginger, pepper,
allspice, and cloves, in the above
proportions. Boil sufficient vinegar to
cover them, which pour over, and, when
cold, cover up to keep them free from dust.
As the other things for the pickle ripen
at different times, they may be added as
they are ready: these will be radish-pods,
French beans, gherkins, small
onions, nasturtiums, capsicums, chilies,
&amp;c., &amp;c. As these are procured, they
must, first of all, be washed in a little
cold vinegar, wiped, and then simply
added to the other ingredients in the
large jar, only taking care that they are
<i>covered</i> by the vinegar. If more vinegar
should be wanted to add to the pickle,
do not omit first to boil it before adding
it to the rest. When you have collected
all the things you require, turn all out in
a large pan, and thoroughly mix them.
Now put the mixed vegetables into
smaller jars, without any of the vinegar;
then boil the vinegar again, adding as
much more as will be required to fill the
different jars, and also cayenne, mustard-seed,
turmeric, and mustard, which
must be well mixed with a little cold
vinegar, allowing the quantities named
above to each gallon of vinegar. Pour
the vinegar, boiling hot, over the pickle,
and when cold, tie down with a bladder.
If the pickle is wanted for immediate
use, the vinegar should be boiled twice
more, but the better way is to make it
during one season for use during the
next. It will keep for years, if care is
taken that the vegetables are quite
covered by the vinegar.</p>

<p>This recipe was taken from the directions
of a lady whose pickle was
always pronounced excellent by all who
tasted it, and who has, for many years,
exactly followed the recipe given above.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—For small families, perhaps the
above quantity of pickle will be considered
too large; but this may be decreased
at pleasure, taking care to properly
proportion the various ingredients.</p>


<h3>PICKLE, Mixed (very good).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each gallon of vinegar
allow ¼ lb. of bruised ginger, ¼ lb. of
mustard, ¼ lb. of salt, 2 oz. of mustard-seed,
1½ oz. of turmeric, 1 oz. of ground
black pepper, ¼ oz. of cayenne, cauliflowers,
onions, celery, sliced cucumbers,
gherkins, French beans, nasturtiums,
capsicums. <i>Mode.</i>—Have a large jar,
with a tightly-fitting lid, in which put
as much vinegar as required, reserving a
little to mix the various powders to a
smooth paste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>. Put into a basin the
mustard, turmeric, pepper, and cayenne;
mix them with vinegar, and stir well
until no lumps remain; add all the ingredients
to the vinegar, and mix well.
Keep this liquor in a warm place, and
thoroughly stir every morning for a
month with a wooden spoon, when it will
be ready for the different vegetables to
be added to it. As these come into season,
have them gathered on a dry day,
and, after merely wiping them with a
cloth, to free them from moisture, put
them into the pickle. The cauliflowers,
it may be said, must be divided into
small bunches. Put all these into the
pickle raw, and at the end of the season,
when there have been added as
many of the vegetables as could be procured,
store it away in jars, and tie over
with bladder. As none of the ingredients
are boiled, this pickle will not be
fit to eat till 12 months have elapsed.
Whilst the pickle is being made, keep a
wooden spoon tied to the jar; and its
contents, it may be repeated, must be
stirred every morning. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
the pickle-liquor in May or June,
as the season arrives for the various
vegetables to be picked.</p>


<h3><a id="PICKLE_for_Tongues_or_Beef"></a>PICKLE for Tongues or Beef
(Newmarket Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 gallon of soft water, 3
lbs. of coarse salt, 6 oz. of coarse brown
sugar, ½ oz. of saltpetre. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
all the ingredients into a saucepan, and
let them boil for ½ an hour, clear off the
scum as it rises, and when done pour the
pickle into a pickling-pan. Let it get
cold, then put in the meat, and allow it
to remain in pickle from 8 to 14 days,
according to the size. It will keep good
for 6 months if well boiled once a fortnight.
Tongues will take 1 month or 6
weeks to be properly cured; and, in
salting meat, beef and tongues should
always be put in separate vessels. <i>Time.</i>—A
moderate-sized tongue should remain
in the pickle about a month, and be
turned every day.</p>


<h3>PICKLE, Universal.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To 6 quarts of vinegar
allow 1 lb. of salt, ¼ lb. of ginger, 1 oz.
of mace, ½ lb. of shalots, 1 tablespoonful
of cayenne, 2 oz. of mustard-seed, 1½ oz.
of turmeric. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil all the ingredients
together for about 20 minutes;
when cold, put them into a jar with
whatever vegetables you choose, such
as radish-pods, French beans, cauliflowers,
gherkins, &amp;c. &amp;c., as these come
into season; put them in fresh as you
gather them, having previously wiped
them perfectly free from moisture and
grit. This pickle will be fit for use in
about 8 or 9 months. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Make the pickle in May or
June, to be ready for the various vegetables.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—As this pickle takes 2 or 3
months to make,—that is to say, nearly
that time will elapse before all the different
vegetables are added,—care must be
taken to keep the jar which contains
the pickle well covered, either with a
closely-fitting lid, or a piece of bladder
securely tied over, so as perfectly to
exclude the air.</p>


<h3>PICKLES.</h3>

<p>Although pickles may be purchased at
shops at as low a rate as they can usually
be made for at home, or perhaps even
for less, yet we would advise all housewives,
who have sufficient time and convenience,
to prepare their own. The
only general rules, perhaps, worth stating
here,—as in the recipes all necessary
details will be explained—are, that
the vegetables and fruits used should be
sound, and not over-ripe, and that the
very best vinegar should be employed.</p>


<h3>PICNIC FOR 40 PERSONS, Bill
of Fare for.</h3>

<p>A joint of cold roast beef, a joint of
cold boiled beef, 2 ribs of lamb, 2
shoulders of lamb, 4 roast fowls, 2 roast
ducks, 1 ham, 1 tongue, 2 veal-and-ham
pies, 2 pigeon pies, 6 medium-sized
lobsters, 1 piece of collared calf’s head,
18 lettuces, 6 baskets of salad, 6 cucumbers.</p>

<p>Stewed fruit well sweetened, and put
into glass bottles well corked; 3 or 4
dozen plain pastry biscuits to eat with
the stewed fruit, 2 dozen fruit turnovers,
4 dozen cheesecakes, 2 cold cabinet puddings
in moulds, 2 blancmanges in
moulds, a few jam puffs, 1 large cold
plum-pudding (this must be good), a few
baskets of fresh fruit, 3 dozen plain biscuits,
a piece of cheese, 6 lbs. of butter
(this, of course, includes the butter for
tea), 4 quartern loaves of household bread,
3 dozen rolls, 6 loaves of tin bread (for
tea), 2 plain plum cakes, 2 pound cakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
2 sponge-cakes, a tin of mixed biscuits,
½ lb. of tea. Coffee is not suitable for a
picnic, being difficult to make.</p>


<h3>PICNIC, Things not to be forgotten
at.</h3>

<p>A stick of horseradish, a bottle of
mint-sauce well corked, a bottle of salad
dressing, a bottle of vinegar, made mustard,
pepper, salt, good oil, and pounded
sugar. If it can be managed, take a little
ice. It is scarcely necessary to say that
plates, tumblers, wine-glasses, knives,
forks, and spoons must not be forgotten;
as also teacups and saucers, 3 or 4 teapots,
some lump sugar, and milk, if this
last-named article cannot be obtained in
the neighbourhood. Take 3 corkscrews.</p>

<p><i>Beverages.</i>—3 dozen quart bottles of
ale, packed in hampers; ginger-beer,
soda-water, and lemonade, of each 2
dozen bottles; 6 bottles of sherry, 6 bottles
of claret, champagne à discrétion,
and any other light wine that may be
preferred, and 2 bottles of brandy.
Water can usually be obtained, so it is
useless to take it.</p>


<h3>PIG, Sucking, to Carve.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/illus-249a.jpg" width="303" height="149" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">SUCKING-PIG.</div>
</div>

<p>A sucking-pig seems, at first sight,
rather an elaborate dish, or rather
animal, to carve; but by carefully mastering
the details of the business, every
difficulty will vanish; and if a partial
failure be at first made, yet all embarrassment
will quickly disappear on a
second trial. A sucking-pig is usually
sent to table in the manner shown in the
engraving, and the first point to be
attended to is to separate the shoulder
from the carcase, by carrying the knife
quickly and neatly round the circular
line, as shown by the figures 1, 2, 3;—the
shoulder will then easily come away.
The next step is to take off the leg; and
this is done in the same way, by cutting
round this joint in the direction shown
by the figures 1, 2, 3, in the same way
as the shoulder. The ribs then stand
fairly open to the knife, which should be
carried down in the direction of the line
4 to 5; and two or three helpings will
dispose of these. The other half of the
pig is served, of course, in the same
manner. Different parts of the pig are
variously esteemed; some preferring the
flesh of the neck; others, the ribs; and
others, again, the shoulders. The truth
is, the whole of a sucking-pig is delicious,
delicate eating; but, in carving it,
the host should consult the various tastes
and fancies of his guests, keeping the
larger joints, generally, for the gentlemen
of the party.</p>




<h3>PIG, Sucking, Roast.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/illus-249b.jpg" width="309" height="155" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">ROAST SUCKING-PIG.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pig, 6 oz. of bread-crumbs,
16 sage-leaves, pepper and salt
to taste, a piece of butter the size of an
egg, salad oil or butter to baste with,
about ½ pint of gravy, 1 tablespoonful of
lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—A sucking-pig, to
be eaten in perfection, should not be
more than three weeks old, and should
be dressed the same day that it is killed.
After preparing the pig for cooking, as
in the following recipe, stuff it with
finely-grated bread-crumbs, minced sage,
pepper, salt, and a piece of butter the
size of an egg, all of which should be
well mixed together, and put into the
body of the pig. Sew up the slit neatly,
and truss the legs back, to allow the
inside to be roasted, and the under part
to be crisp. Put the pig down to a
bright clear fire, not too near, and let it
lay till thoroughly dry; then have ready
some butter tied up in a piece of thin
cloth, and rub the pig with this in every
part. Keep it well rubbed with the
butter the whole of the time it is roasting,
and do not allow the crackling to
become blistered or burnt. When half-done,
hang a pig-iron before the middle
part (if this is not obtainable, use a flat
iron), to prevent its being scorched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
dried up before the ends are done.
Before it is taken from the fire, out off
the head, and part that and the body
down the middle. Chop the brains and
mix them with the stuffing; add ½ pint
of good gravy, a tablespoonful of lemon-juice,
and the gravy that flowed from
the pig; put a little of this on the dish
with the pig, and the remainder send to
table in a tureen. Place the pig back to
back in the dish, with one half of the
head on each side, and one of the ears at
each end, and send it to table as hot as
possible. Instead of butter, many cooks
take salad oil for basting, which makes
the crackling <i>crisp</i>; and as this is one
of the principal things to be considered,
perhaps it is desirable to use it; but be
particular that it is very pure, or it will
impart an unpleasant flavour to the meat.
The brains and stuffing may be stirred
into a tureen of melted butter instead of
gravy, when the latter is not liked.
Apple sauce and the old-fashioned currant sauce
are not yet quite obsolete as an
accompaniment to roast pig. <i>Time.</i>—1½
to 2 hours for a small pig. <i>Average
cost</i>, 5<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 9 or 10 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from September to
February.</p>


<h3>PIG, Sucking, to Scald a.</h3>

<p>Put the pig into cold water directly it
is killed; let it remain for a few minutes,
then immerse it in a large pan of boiling
water for 2 minutes. Take it out, lay
it on a table, and pull off the hair as
quickly as possible. When the skin
looks clean, make a slit down the belly,
take out the entrails, well clean the nostrils
and ears, wash the pig in cold
water, and wipe it thoroughly dry.
Take off the feet at the first joint, and
loosen and leave sufficient skin to turn
neatly over. If not to be dressed immediately,
fold it in a wet cloth to keep
it from the air.</p>


<h3>PIGS’ CHEEKS, to Dry.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Salt, ½ oz. of saltpetre,
2 oz. of bay-salt, 4 oz. of coarse sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut out the snout, remove the
brains, and split the head, taking off the
upper bone to make the jowl a good
shape; rub it well with salt; next day
take away the brine, and salt it again
the following day; cover the head with
saltpetre, bay-salt, and coarse sugar, in
the above proportion, adding a little
common salt. Let the head be often
turned, and when it has been in the
pickle for 10 days, smoke it for a week
or rather longer. <i>Time.</i>—To remain in
the pickle 10 days; to be smoked 1
week. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Should be made
from September to March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A pig’s cheek, or Bath chap,
will require two hours’ cooking after the
water boils.</p>


<h3>PIG’S FACE, Collared (a Breakfast
or Luncheon Dish).</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 238px;">
<img src="images/illus-250.jpg" width="238" height="117" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">PIG’S FACE.</div>

bacon very finely, and mix with these
the remaining ingredients, taking care
that the whole is thoroughly incorporated.
Spread this equally over the
head, roll it tightly in a cloth, and bind
it securely with broad tape. Put it into
a saucepan with a few meat trimmings,
and cover it with stock; let it simmer
gently for 4 hours, and be particular that
it does not stop boiling the whole time.
When quite tender, take it up, put
it between 2 dishes with a heavy weight
on the top, and when cold, remove the
cloth and tape. It should be sent to
table on a napkin, or garnished with
a piece of deep white paper with a ruche

pepper and salt to taste, thickening of
butter and flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the liver,
heart, and pettitoes into a stewpan with
the bacon, mace, peppercorns, thyme,
onion, and gravy, and simmer these
gently for ¼ hour; then take out the
heart and liver, and mince them very
fine. Keep stewing the feet until quite
tender, which will be in from 20 minutes
to ½ hour, reckoning from the time that
they boiled up first; then put back the
minced liver, thicken the gravy with
a little butter and flour, season with
pepper and salt, and simmer over a gentle
fire for 5 minutes, occasionally stirring
the contents. Dish the mince, split the
feet, and arrange them round alternately
with sippets of toasted bread, and pour
the gravy in the middle. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether
40 minutes. <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September to
March.</p>


<h3>PIGEON, to Carve.</h3>

<p>A very straightforward plan is adopted
in carving a pigeon: the knife is carried
sharply in the
direction of the
line as shown
from 1 to 2, entirely
through
the bird, cutting
it into two
precisely equal
and similar parts. If it is necessary
to make three pieces of it, a small wing
should be cut off with the leg on either
side, thus serving two guests; and, by
this means, there will be sufficient meat
left on the breast to send to the third
guest.</p>

<h3>PIGEON PIE (Epsom Grand-Stand
Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of rump-steak, 2
or 3 pigeons, 3 slices of ham, pepper and
salt to taste, 2 oz. of butter, 4 eggs, puff
crust. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the steak into pieces
about 3 inches square, and with it line
the bottom of a pie-dish, seasoning it well
with pepper and salt. Clean the pigeons,
rub them with pepper and salt inside
and out, and put into the body of each
rather more than ½ oz. of butter; lay
them on the steak, and a piece of ham on
each pigeon. Add the yolks of four
eggs, and half fill the dish with stock;
place a border of puff paste round the
edge of the dish, put on the cover, and
ornament it in any way that may be preferred.
Clean three of the feet, and
place them in a hole made in the crust at
the top: this shows what kind of pie it
is. Glaze the crust,—that is to say,
brush it over with the yolk of an egg,—and
bake it in a well-heated oven for
about 1¼ hour. When liked, a seasoning
of pounded mace may be added.
<i>Time.</i>—1¼ hour, or rather less. <i>Average
cost</i>, 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>


<h3>PIGEONS, Broiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pigeons, 3 oz. of butter,
pepper and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Take
care that the pigeons are quite fresh, and
carefully pluck, draw, and wash them;
split the backs, rub the birds over with
butter, season them with pepper and
salt, and broil them over a moderate
fire for ¼ hour or 20 minutes. Serve very
hot, with either mushroom-sauce or a
good gravy. Pigeons may also be plainly
boiled, and served with parsley and
butter; they should be trussed like
boiled fowls, and take from ¼ hour to
20 minutes to boil. <i>Time.</i>—To broil a
pigeon, from ¼ hour to 20 minutes;
to boil one, the same time. <i>Average cost</i>,
from 6<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i> from
April to September, but in the greatest
perfection from Midsummer to Michaelmas.</p>


<h3>PIGEONS, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pigeons, 3 oz. of butter,
pepper and salt to taste. <i>Trussing.</i>—Pigeons,
to be good, should be eaten
fresh (if kept a little, the flavour goes
off), and they should be drawn as soon
as killed. Cut off the heads and necks,
truss the wings over the backs, and cut
off the toes at the first joint: previous to
trussing, they should be carefully cleaned,
as no bird requires so much washing.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wipe the birds very dry, season
them inside with pepper and salt, and
put about ¾ oz. of butter into the body
of each: this makes them moist. Place
them at a bright fire, and baste them
well the whole of the time they are
cooking (they will be done enough in
from 20 to 30 minutes); garnish with
fried parsley, and serve with a tureen of
parsley and butter. Bread sauce and
gravy, the same as for roast fowl, are
exceedingly nice accompaniments to roast
pigeons, as also egg-sauce. <i>Time.</i>—From
20 minutes to ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i>
to 9<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i> from April to
September; but in the greatest perfection
from Midsummer to Michaelmas.</p>

</div>


<h3>PIGEONS, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 pigeons, a few slices of
bacon, 3 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls
of minced parsley, sufficient stock to
cover the pigeons, thickening of butter
and flour, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom
ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of port wine.
<i>Mode.</i>—Empty and clean the pigeons
thoroughly, mince the livers, add to
these the parsley and butter, and put it
into the insides of the birds. Truss
them with the legs inward, and put them
into a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon
placed under and over them; add the
stock, and stew gently for rather more
than ½ hour. Dish the pigeons, strain
the gravy, thicken it with butter and
flour, add the ketchup and port wine,
give one boil, pour over the pigeons, and
serve. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more than ½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
April to September.</p>


<h3>PIKE, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 or 2 pike, a nice delicate
stuffing (<i>see</i> <a href="#FORCEMEATS">Forcemeats</a>), 1 egg,
bread-crumbs, ¼ lb. butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Scale
the fish, take out the gills, wash,
and wipe it thoroughly dry; stuff it
with forcemeat, sew it up, and fasten
the tail in the mouth by means of a
skewer; brush it over with egg, sprinkle
with bread-crumbs, and baste with
butter, before putting it in the oven,
which must be well heated. When the
pike is of a nice brown colour, cover
it with buttered paper, as the outside
would become too dry. If 2 are dressed,
a little variety may be made by making
one of them green with a little chopped
parsley mixed with the bread-crumbs.
Serve anchovy or Dutch sauce, and plain
melted butter with it. <i>Time.</i>—According
to size, 1 hour, more or less. <i>Average
cost.</i>—Seldom bought. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Pike <i>à la genévése</i> may be
stewed in the same manner as salmon <i>à
la genévése</i>.</p>


<h3>PIKE, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of salt to each
gallon of water; a little vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Scale
and clean the pike, and fasten
the tail in its mouth by means of a
skewer. Lay it in cold water, and when
it boils, throw in the salt and vinegar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
The time for boiling depends, of course,
on the size of the fish; but a middling-sized
pike will take about ½ an hour.
Serve with Dutch or anchovy sauce, and
plain melted butter. <i>Time.</i>—According
to size, ½ to 1 hour. <i>Average cost.</i>—Seldom
bought. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to March.</p>


<h3>PILLAU FOWL, based on M. Soyer’s
Recipe (an Indian Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of rice, 2 oz. of butter,
a fowl, 2 quarts of stock or good
broth, 40 cardamum-seeds, ½ oz. of coriander-seed,
¼ oz. of cloves, ¼ oz. of
allspice, ¼ oz. of mace, ¼ oz. of cinnamon,
½ oz. of peppercorns, 4 onions, 6 thin
slices of bacon, 2 hard-boiled eggs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Well wash 1 lb. of the best
Patna rice, put it into a frying-pan with
the butter, which keep moving over
a slow fire until the rice is lightly
browned. Truss the fowl as for boiling,
put it into a stewpan with the stock
or broth; pound the spices and seeds
thoroughly in a mortar, tie them in
a piece of muslin, and put them in with
the fowl. Let it boil slowly until it
is nearly done; then add the rice, which
should stew until quite tender and almost
dry; cut the onions into slices, sprinkle
them with flour, and fry, without breaking
them, of a nice brown colour. Have
ready the slices of bacon curled and
grilled, and the eggs boiled hard. Lay
the fowl in the form of a pyramid upon a
dish, smother with the rice, garnish with
the bacon, fried onions, and the hard-boiled
eggs cut into quarters, and serve
very hot. Before taking the rice out,
remove the spices. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour to
stew the fowl without the rice; ½ hour
with it. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE CHIPS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pineapples; sugar to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare and slice the fruit
thinly, put it on dishes, and strew over
it plenty of pounded sugar. Keep it in
a hot closet, or very slow oven, 8 or 10
days, and turn the fruit every day until
dry; then put the pieces of pine on tins,
and place them in a quick oven for 10
minutes. Let them cool, and store them
away in dry boxes, with paper between
each layer. <i>Time.</i>—8 to 10 days. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Foreign
pines, in July and
August.</p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE FRITTERS (an
elegant dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A small pineapple, a
small wineglassful of brandy or liqueur,
2 oz. of sifted sugar; batter as for <a href="#APPLE_FRITTERS">apple
fritters</a>, which see. <i>Mode.</i>—This elegant
dish, although it may appear extravagant,
is really not so if made when pineapples
are plentiful. We receive them
now in such large quantities from the
West Indies, that at times they may be
purchased at an exceedingly low rate;
it would not, of course, be economical
to use the pines which are grown in our
English pineries for the purposes of
fritters. Pare the pine with as little
waste as possible, cut it into rather thin
slices, and soak these slices in the above
proportion of brandy or liqueur and
pounded sugar for 4 hours; then make a
batter the same as for apple fritters,
substituting cream for the milk, and
using a smaller quantity of flour; when
this is ready, dip in the pieces of
pine, and fry them in boiling lard from
5 to 8 minutes; turn them when sufficiently
brown on one side, and, when
done, drain them from the lard before
the fire, dish them on a white d’oyley,
strew over them sifted sugar, and serve
quickly. <i>Time.</i>—5 to 8 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, when cheap and plentiful,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the pine. <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in July and August.</p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE, Preserved.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit,
weighed after being pared, allow 1 lb. of
loaf sugar; ¼ pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—The
pines for making this preserve should
be perfectly sound but ripe. Cut them
into rather thick slices, as the fruit
shrinks very much in the boiling. Pare
off the rind carefully, that none of the
pine be wasted; and, in doing so, notch
it in and out, as the edge cannot be
smoothly cut without great waste. Dissolve
a portion of the sugar in a preserving-pan
with ¼ pint of water; when this
is melted, gradually add the remainder
of the sugar, and boil it until it forms a
clear syrup, skimming well. As soon as
this is the case, put in the pieces of pine,
and boil well for at least ½ hour, or until
it looks nearly transparent. Put it into
pots, cover down when cold, and store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
away in a dry place. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour to
boil the fruit. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>
per lb. pot. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Foreign pines,
in July and August.</p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE, Preserved, for present
use.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pineapple, sugar, water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut the pine into slices ¼ inch
in thickness; peel them, and remove the
hard part from the middle. Put the
parings and hard pieces into a stewpan,
with sufficient water to cover them, and
boil for 1 hour. Strain the liquor, and
put in the slices of pine. Stew them for
10 minutes, add sufficient sugar to
sweeten the whole nicely, and boil again
for another ¼ hour; skim well, and the
preserve will be ready for use. It must
be eaten soon, as it will keep but a very
short time. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour to boil the
parings in water; 10 minutes to boil the
pine without sugar, ¼ hour with sugar.
<i>Average cost.</i>—Foreign pines, 1<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i>
each; English, from 2<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> per lb.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Foreign, in July and August;
English, all the year.</p>


<h3>PIPPINS, Normandy, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of Normandy pippins,
1 quart of water, ½ teaspoonful of
powdered cinnamon, ½ teaspoonful of
ground ginger, 1 lb. of moist sugar, 1
lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Well wash the pippins,
and put them into 1 quart of water with
the above proportion of cinnamon and
ginger, and let them stand 12 hours;
then put these all together into a stewpan,
with the lemon sliced thinly, and
half the moist sugar. Let them boil
slowly until the pippins are half done;
then add the remainder of the sugar,
and simmer until they are quite tender.
Serve on glass dishes for dessert. <i>Time.</i>—2
to 3 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Suitable for a winter dish.</p>


<h3>PLAICE, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Hot lard, or clarified
dripping; egg and bread-crumbs.
<i>Mode.</i>—This fish is fried in the same
manner as soles. Wash and wipe them
thoroughly dry, and let them remain in
a cloth until it is time to dress them.
Brush them over with egg, and cover
with bread-crumbs mixed with a little
flour. Fry of a nice brown in hot dripping
or lard, and garnish with fried parsley
and cut lemon. Send them to table
with shrimp-sauce and plain melted
butter. <i>Time.</i>—About 5 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 3<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i> from
May to November. <i>Sufficient</i>, 4 plaice
for 4 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Plaice may be boiled plain,
and served with melted butter. Garnish
with parsley and cut lemon.</p>


<h3>PLAICE, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 or 5 plaice, 2 onions,
½ oz. ground ginger, 1 pint of lemon-juice,
¼ pint water, 6 eggs; cayenne to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the fish into pieces
about 2 inches wide, salt them, and let
them remain ¼ hour. Slice and fry the
onions a light brown; put them in a
stewpan, on the top of which put the
fish without washing, and add the ginger,
lemon-juice, and water. Cook slowly
for ½ hour, and do not let the fish boil,
or it will break. Take it out, and when
the liquor is cool, add 6 well-beaten eggs;
simmer till it thickens, when pour over
the fish, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour.
<i>Average cost</i> for this quantity, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> from May to November.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons; according to
the size of the fish.</p>


<h3>PLOVERS, to Carve.</h3>

<p>Plovers may be carved like quails or
woodcock, being trussed and served in
the same way as those birds.</p>


<h3>PLOVERS, to Dress.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 plovers, butter, flour,
toasted bread. <i>Choosing and Trussing.</i>—Choose
those that feel hard at the vent,
as that shows their fatness. There are
three sorts,—the grey, green, and bastard
plover, or lapwing. They will keep
good for some time, but if very stale,
the feet will be very dry. Plovers are
scarcely fit for anything but roasting;
they are, however, sometimes stewed, or
made into a ragoût, but this mode of
cooking is not to be recommended.
<i>Mode.</i>—Pluck off the feathers, wipe
the outside of the birds with a damp
cloth, and do not draw them; truss with
the head under the wing, put them down
to a clear fire, and lay slices of moistened
toast in the dripping-pan, to catch the
trail. Keep them <i>well basted</i>, dredge
them lightly with flour a few minutes
before they are done, and let them be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
nicely frothed. Dish them on the toasts,
over which the <i>traill</i> should be equally
spread. Pour round the toast a little
good gravy, and send some to table in a
tureen. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes to ¼ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the brace, if plentiful.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 2 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—In
perfection from the beginning
of September to the end of January.</p>


<h3>PLUM CAKE, Common.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 lbs. of flour, 6 oz. of
butter or good dripping, 6 oz. of moist
sugar, 6 oz. of currants, ½ oz. of pounded
allspice, 2 tablespoonfuls of fresh yeast,
1 pint of new milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub the
butter into the flour; add the sugar,
currants, and allspice; warm the milk,
stir to it the yeast, and mix the whole
into a dough; knead it well, and put it
into 6 buttered tins; place them near the
fire for nearly an hour for the dough to
rise, then bake the cakes in a good oven
from 1 to 1¼ hour. To ascertain when
they are done, plunge a clean knife into
the middle, and if on withdrawal it comes
out clean, the cakes are done. <i>Time.</i>—1
to 1¼ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> to make 6 small cakes.</p>


<h3>PLUM CAKE, a Nice.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ¼ lb. of
butter, ½ lb. of sugar, ½ lb. of currants,
2 oz. of candied lemon-peel, ½ pint of
milk, 1 teaspoonful of ammonia or carbonate
of soda. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the flour
into a basin with the sugar, currants,
and sliced candied peel; beat the butter
to a cream, and mix all these ingredients
together with the milk. Stir the ammonia
into 2 tablespoonfuls of milk; add
it to the dough, and beat the whole well,
until everything is thoroughly mixed.
Put the dough into a buttered tin, and
bake the cake from 1½ to 2 hours. <i>Time.</i>—1½<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">to 2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i></span><br />
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>PLUM JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of plums,
weighed before being stoned, allow ¾ lb.
of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—In making plum
jam, the quantity of sugar for each lb.
of fruit must be regulated by the quality
and size of the fruit, some plums requiring
much more sugar than others. Divide
the plums, take out the stones, and put
them on to large dishes, with roughly-pounded
sugar sprinkled over them in
the above proportion, and let them remain
for one day; then put them into a
preserving-pan, stand them by the side
of the fire to simmer gently for about ½
hour, and then boil them rapidly for
another 15 minutes. The scum must be
carefully removed as it rises, and the
jam must be well stirred all the time, or
it will burn at the bottom of the pan,
and so spoil the colour and flavour of the
preserve. Some of the stones may be
cracked, and a few kernels added to the
jam just before it is done: these impart
a very delicious flavour to the plums.
The above proportion of sugar would
answer for Orleans plums; the Impératrice,
Magnum-bonum, and Winesour
would not require quite so much. <i>Time.</i>—½
hour to simmer gently, ¼ hour to boil
rapidly. <i>Best plums for preserving.</i>—Violets,
Mussels, Orleans, Impératrice,
Magnum-bonum, and Winesour. <i>Seasonable</i>
from the end of July to the beginning
of October.</p>


<h3>PLUM PUDDING, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of
currants, 1 lb. of raisins, 1 lb. of suet,
2 eggs, 1 pint of milk, a few slices of
candied peel. <i>Mode.</i>—Chop the suet
finely; mix it with the flour, currants,
stoned raisins, and candied peel; moisten
with the well-beaten eggs, and add sufficient
milk to make the pudding of the
consistency of very thick batter. Put it
into a buttered dish, and bake in a good
oven from 2¼ to 2½ hours; turn it out,
strew sifted sugar over, and serve. For
a very plain pudding, use only half the
quantity of fruit, omit the eggs, and substitute
milk or water for them. The
above ingredients make a large family
pudding; for a small one, half the quantity
will be found ample; but it must be
baked quite 1½ hour. <i>Time.</i>—Large
pudding, 2¼ to 2½ hours; half the size,
1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 9 or 10 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in
winter.</p>


<h3>PLUM PUDDING, Excellent, made
without Eggs.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of flour, 6 oz. of
raisins, 6 oz. of currants, ¼ lb. of chopped
suet, ¼ lb. of brown sugar, ¼ lb. of
mashed carrot, ¼ lb. of mashed potatoes,
1 tablespoonful of treacle, 1 oz. of candied
lemon-peel, 1 oz. of candied citron.
<i>Mode.</i>—Mix the flour, currants, suet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
sugar well together; have ready the
above proportions of mashed carrot and
potato, which stir into the other ingredients;
add the treacle and lemon-peel;
but put no liquid in the mixture, or it
will be spoiled. Tie it loosely in a cloth,
or, if put in a basin, do not quite fill it,
as the pudding should have room to
swell, and boil it for 4 hours. Serve with
brandy-sauce. This pudding is better
for being mixed over-night. <i>Time.</i>—4
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in
winter.</p>


<h3>PLUM PUDDING, Unrivalled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of muscatel
raisins, 1¾ lb. of currants, 1 lb. of sultana
raisins, 2 lbs. of the finest moist
sugar, 2 lbs. of bread-crumbs, 16 eggs, 2
lbs. of finely-chopped suet, 6 oz. of
mixed candied peel, the rind of 2 lemons,
1 oz. of ground nutmeg, 1 oz. of ground
cinnamon, ½ oz. of pounded bitter almonds,
¼ pint of brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Stone
and cut up the raisins, but do not chop
them; wash and dry the currants, and
cut the candied peel into thin slices.
Mix all the dry ingredients well together,
and moisten with the eggs, which should
be well beaten and strained, to the pudding;
stir in the brandy, and, when all
is thoroughly mixed, well butter and
flour a stout new pudding-cloth; put in
the pudding, tie it down very tightly
and closely, boil from 6 to 8 hours,
and serve with brandy-sauce. A few
sweet almonds, blanched and cut in
strips, and stuck on the pudding, ornament
it prettily. This quantity may be
divided and boiled in buttered moulds.
For small families this is the most desirable
way, as the above will be found to
make a pudding of rather large dimensions.
<i>Time.</i>—6 to 8 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> in winter.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 12 or 14 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The muscatel raisins can be
purchased at a cheap rate loose (not in
bunches): they are then scarcely higher
in price than the ordinary raisins, and
impart a much richer flavour to the
pudding.</p>


<h3>PLUM PUDDING, a Plain Christmas,
for Children.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, 1 lb. of

strain the eggs to the pudding, stir these
in, and add just sufficient milk to make
it mix properly. Tie it up in a well-floured
cloth, put it into boiling water,
and boil for at least 5 hours. Serve
with a sprig of holly placed in the middle
of the pudding, and a little pounded
sugar sprinkled over it. <i>Time.</i>—5 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 9 or

<div class="caption">CHRISTMAS PLUM PUDDING IN MOULD.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of raisins, ½ lb. of
currants, ½ lb. of mixed peel, ¾ lb. of bread-crumbs,
¾ lb. of suet, 8 eggs, l wineglassful
of brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Stone and cut the raisins
in halves, but do not chop them; wash,
pick, and dry the currants, and mince
the suet finely; cut the candied peel into
thin slices, and grate down the bread
into fine crumbs. When all these dry ingredients
are prepared, mix them well
together; then moisten the mixture with
the eggs, which should be well beaten,
and the brandy; stir well, that everything
may be very thoroughly blended,
and <i>press</i> the pudding into a buttered
mould; tie it down tightly with a floured
cloth, and boil for 5 or 6 hours. It may
be boiled in a cloth without a mould, and
will require the same time allowed for
cooking. As Christmas puddings are
usually made a few days before they are
required for table, when the pudding is
taken out of the pot, hang it up immediately,
and put a plate or saucer underneath
to catch the water that may drain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
from it. The day it is to be eaten,
plunge it into boiling water, and keep it
boiling for at least 2 hours; then turn
it out of the mould, and serve
with brandy-sauce. On Christmas-day a
sprig of holly is usually placed in the
middle of the pudding, and about a wineglassful
of brandy poured round it,
which, at the moment of serving, is
lighted, and the pudding thus brought
to table encircled in flame. <i>Time.</i>—5 or
6 hours the first time of boiling; 2 hours
the day it is to be served. <i>Average cost</i>,
4<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a quart mould for 7 or
8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> on the 25th of
December, and on various festive occasions
till March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Five or six of these puddings
should be made at one time, as they will
keep good for many weeks, and in cases
where unexpected guests arrive, will be
found an acceptable and, as it only requires
warming through, a quickly-prepared
dish. Moulds of every shape
and size are manufactured for these puddings,
and may be purchased of Messrs.
R. &amp; J. Slack, 336, Strand.</p>


<h3>PLUM PUDDING (a Pound).</h3>

<h3>PLUMS, French, Stewed (a Dessert
dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of French plums,
¾ pint of syrup, 1 glass of port wine, the
rind and juice of 1 lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Stew
the plums gently in water for 1 hour;
strain the water, and with it make the
syrup. When it is clear, put in the
plums with the port wine, lemon-juice,
and rind, and simmer very gently for 1½
hour. Arrange the plums on a glass
dish, take out the lemon-rind, pour the
syrup over the plums, and, when cold,
they will be ready for table. A little
allspice stewed with the fruit is by many
persons considered an improvement.
<i>Time.</i>—1 hour to stew the plums in
water, 1½ hour in the syrup. <i>Average
cost</i>, plums sufficiently good for stewing,
1<i>s.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in winter.</p>


<h3>PLUMS (Preserved).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit
allow ¾ lb. of loaf sugar; for the thin
syrup, ¼ lb. of sugar to each pint of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Select large ripe plums;
slightly prick them, to prevent them
from bursting, and simmer them very
gently in a syrup made with the above
proportion of sugar and water. Put
them carefully into a pan, let the syrup
cool, pour it over the plums, and allow
them to remain for two days. Having
previously weighed the other sugar, dip
the lumps quickly into water, and put
them into a preserving-pan with no more
water than hangs about them; and boil
the sugar to a syrup, carefully skimming
it. Drain the plums from the first syrup;
put them into the fresh syrup, and simmer
them very gently until they are
clear; lift them out singly into pots,
pour the syrup over, and, when cold,
cover down to exclude the air. This
preserve will remain good some time,
if kept in a dry place, and makes a
very nice addition to a dessert. The
magnum-bonum plums answer for this
preserve better than any other kind
of plum. Greengages are also very
delicious done in this manner. <i>Time.</i>—¼
hour to 20 minutes to simmer the
plums in the first syrup; 20 minutes
to ½ hour very gentle simmering in the
second. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to
October.</p>


<h3>PLUMS, to Preserve Dry.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of sugar
allow ¼ pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Gather
the plums when they are full grown and
just turning colour; prick them, put
them into a saucepan of cold water, and
set them on the fire until the water is on
the point of boiling. Then take them
out, drain them, and boil them gently
in syrup made with the above proportion
of sugar and water; and if the plums
shrink, and will not take the sugar,
prick them as they lie in the pan; give
them another boil, skim, and set them
by. The next day add some more
sugar, boiled almost to candy, to the
fruit and syrup; put all together into a
wide-mouthed jar, and place them in a
cool oven for 2 nights; then drain the
plums from the syrup, sprinkle a little
powdered sugar over, and dry them in a
cool oven. <i>Time.</i>—15 to 20 minutes to
boil the plums in the syrup. <i>Seasonable</i>
from August to October.</p>


<h3>PORK.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 169px;">
<img src="images/illus-259.jpg" width="169" height="463" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">SIDE OF A PIG,
SHOWING THE
SEVERAL JOINTS</div>
</div>
<p>In the country, where, for ordinary
consumption, the pork killed for sale is
usually both larger and fatter than that
supplied to the London consumer, it is
customary to remove the skin and fat
down to the lean, and, salting that, roast
what remains of the joint. Pork goes
further, and is consequently a more
economical food, than other meats, simply
because the texture is closer, and there
is less waste in the cooking, either in
roasting or boiling.</p>

<p>In fresh pork, the leg is the most
economical family joint, and the loin the
richest.</p>


<p>Pork, to be preserved, is cured in
several ways,—either by covering it with
salt, or immersing it in ready-made brine,
where it is kept till required; or it is
only partially salted, and then hung up
to dry, when the meat is called white
bacon; or, after salting, it is hung in
wood smoke till the flesh is impregnated
with the aroma from the wood. The
Wiltshire bacon, which is regarded as
the finest in the kingdom, is prepared
by laying the sides of a hog in large
wooden troughs, and then rubbing into
the flesh quantities of powdered bay-salt,
made hot in a frying-pan. This
process is repeated for four days; they
are then left for three weeks, merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
turning the flitches every other day,
After that time they are hung up to dry.
The hogs usually killed for purposes of
bacon in England average from 18 to
20 stone; on the other hand, the hogs
killed in the country
for farm-house purposes,
seldom weigh
less than 26 stone.
The legs of boars,
hogs, and, in Germany,
those of bears,
are prepared differently,
and called
hams.</p>

<p>The  practice  in
vogue formerly in this
country was to cut
out the hams and cure
them separately; then
to remove the ribs,
which were roasted
as “spare-ribs,” and,
curing the remainder
of the side, call it a
“gammon of bacon.”</p>



<p>Small pork to cut
for table in joints, is
cut up, in most places
throughout the kingdom,
as represented
in the engraving. The
side is divided with
nine ribs to the fore
quarter; and the following is an enumeration
of the joints in the two respective
quarters:—</p>

<p>Of a bacon pig, the legs are reserved for
curing, and when cured are called hams:
when the meat is separated from the
shoulder-blade and bones and cured, it
is called bacon. The bones, with part of
the meat left on them, are divided into
spare-ribs, griskins, and chines.</p>


<h3>PORK CHEESE (an Excellent
Breakfast Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of cold roast pork,
pepper and salt to taste, 1 dessertspoonful
of minced parsley, 4 leaves of sage, a
very small bunch of savoury herbs, 2
blades of pounded mace, a little nutmeg,
½ teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel;

gravy, and bake rather more
than one hour. When cold, turn it out
of the mould. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more than
1 hour. <i>Seasonable</i> from October to
March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The remains of a pig’s head,
after the chops are taken off, make most
excellent pork cheese.</p>


<h3>PORK CUTLETS, or Chops.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Loin of pork, pepper
and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the cutlets
from a delicate loin of pork, bone
and trim them neatly, and cut away the
greater portion of the fat. Season them
with pepper; place the gridiron on the
fire; when quite hot, lay on the chops,
and broil them for about ¼ hour, turning
them 3 or 4 times; and be particular
that they are <i>thoroughly</i> done, but not
dry. Dish them, sprinkle over a little
fine salt, and serve plain, or with tomato
sauce, sauce piquante, or pickled gherkins,
a few of which should be laid round
the dish as a garnish. <i>Time.</i>—About ¼
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. for

<h3>PORK CUTLETS, or Chops.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Loin, or fore-loin, of
pork, egg and bread-crumbs, salt and
pepper to taste; to every tablespoonful
of bread-crumbs allow ½ teaspoonful of
minced sage; clarified butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the cutlets from a loin, or fore-loin,
of pork; trim them the same as mutton
cutlets, and scrape the top part of the
bone. Brush them over with egg, sprinkle
with bread-crumbs, with which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
been mixed minced sage and a seasoning
of pepper and salt; drop a little clarified
butter on them, and press the crumbs
well down. Put the frying-pan on the
fire, put in some lard; when this is hot,
lay in the cutlets, and fry them a light
brown on both sides. Take them out,
put them before the fire to dry the
greasy moisture from them, and dish
them on mashed potatoes. Serve with
them any sauce that may be preferred;
such as tomato sauce, sauce piquante,
sauce Robert, or pickled gherkins.
<i>Time.</i>—From 15 to 20 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. for chops. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
6 cutlets for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>

<div class="caption">SPARE-RIB OF PORK.</div>
</div>
<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pork; a little powdered
sage. <i>Mode.</i>—As this joint frequently
comes to table hard and dry, particular
care should be taken that it is well
basted. Put it down to a bright fire,
and flour it. About 10 minutes before
taking it up, sprinkle over some powdered
sage; make a little gravy in the
dripping-pan, strain it over the meat,
and serve with a tureen of apple sauce.
This joint will be done in far less time
than when the skin is left on, consequently,
should have the greatest attention
that it be not dried up. <i>Time.</i>—Griskin
of pork weighing 6 lbs., 1½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for
5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to March.</p>

<h3>PORK, Hashed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold
roast pork, 2 onions, 1 teaspoonful of
flour, 2 blades of pounded mace, 2
cloves, 1 tablespoonful of vinegar, ½ pint
of gravy, pepper and salt to taste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Chop the onions and fry them
of a nice brown; cut the pork into thin
slices, season them with pepper and salt,
and add these to the remaining ingredients.
Stew gently for about ½ hour,
and serve garnished with sippets of
toasted bread. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, exclusive of the meat, 3<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
from October to March.</p>


<h3>PORK, Boiled Leg of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Leg of pork; salt. <i>Mode.</i>—For
boiling, choose a small, compact,
well-filled leg, and rub it well with salt;
let it remain in pickle for a week or
ten days, turning and rubbing it every
day. An hour before dressing it, put it
into cold water for an hour, which improves
the colour. If the pork is purchased
ready salted, ascertain how long
the meat has been in pickle, and soak
it accordingly. Put it into a boiling-pot,
with sufficient cold water to cover it;
let it gradually come to a boil, and remove
the scum as it rises. Simmer it
very gently until tender, and do not
allow it to boil fast, or the knuckle will
fall to pieces before the middle of the
leg is done. Carrots, turnips, or parsnips
may be boiled with the pork, some
of which should be laid round the dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
as a garnish. A well-made pease-pudding
is an indispensable accompaniment.
<i>Time.</i>—A leg of pork weighing
8 lbs., 3 hours after the water boils, and
to be simmered very gently. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September to
March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The liquor in which a leg of
pork has been boiled makes excellent
pea-soup.</p>


<h3>PORK, Roast Leg of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Leg of pork, a little,
oil, sage and onion stuffing. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose
a small leg of pork, and
score the skin across in narrow strips,
about ¼ inch
apart. Cut a
slit in the
knuckle,
loosen the
skin, and fill
it with a sage-and-onion
stuffing.
Brush the joint over with a little salad-oil
(this makes the crackling crisper, and
a better colour), and put it down to a
bright, clear fire, not too near, as that
would cause the skin to blister. Baste
it well, and serve with a little gravy
made in the dripping-pan, and do not
omit to send to table with it a tureen of
well-made apple sauce. <i>Time.</i>—A leg
of pork weighing 8 lbs., about 3 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for
6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to March.</p>

<h3>PORK, Leg of, to Carve.</h3>

<p>This joint, which is such a favourite
one with many people, is easy to carve.
The knife
should be carried
sharply
down to the
bone, clean
through the
crackling, in
the direction
of the line 1 to
2. Sage and
onion and apple sauce are usually sent
to table with this dish,—sometimes the
leg of pork is stuffed,—and the guests
should be asked if they will have either
or both. A frequent plan, and we
think a good one, is now pursued, of
sending sage and onion to table separately
from the joint, as it is not everybody
to whom the flavour of this stuffing
is agreeable.</p>

<img src="images/illus-261c.jpg" width="231" height="89" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">FORE LOIN OF PORK.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pork; a little salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—Score the skin in strips rather
more than ¼ inch apart, and place the
joint at a good distance from the fire, on
account of the crackling, which would
harden before the meat would be heated
through, were it placed too near. If
very lean, it should be rubbed over with
a little salad oil, and kept well basted all
the time it is at the fire. Pork should
be very thoroughly cooked, but not dry;
and be careful never to send it to table
the least underdone, as nothing is more
unwholesome and disagreeable than
under-dressed white meats. Serve with
apple sauce and a little gravy made in
the dripping-pan. A stuffing of sage
and onion may be made separately, and
baked in a flat dish: this method is
better than putting it in the meat, as
many persons have so great an objection
to the flavour. <i>Time.</i>—A loin of pork
weighing 5 lbs., about 2 hours: allow
more time should it be very fat. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September to
March.</p>

<h3>PORK, to Pickle.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of saltpetre; salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—As pork does not keep long
without being salted, cut it into pieces
of a suitable size as soon as the pig is
cold. Rub the pieces of pork well with
salt, and put them into a pan with a
sprinkling of it between each piece: as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
it melts on the top, strew on more.
Lay a coarse cloth over the pan, a board
over that, and a weight on the board,
to keep the pork down in the brine. If
excluded from the air, it will continue
good for nearly 2 years. <i>Average cost</i>,
10<i>d.</i> per lb. for the prime parts. <i>Seasonable.</i>—The
best time for pickling meat is
late in the autumn.</p>


<h3>PORK, Pickled, to Boil.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Pork; water. <i>Mode.</i>—Should
the pork be very salt, let it remain
in water about 2 hours before it is
dressed; put it into a saucepan with
sufficient cold water to cover it, let it
gradually come to a boil, then gently
simmer until quite tender. Allow ample
time for it to cook, as nothing is more
disagreeable than underdone pork, and
when boiled fast, the meat becomes
hard. This is sometimes served with
boiled poultry and roast veal, instead of
bacon: when tender, and not over salt,
it will be found equally good. <i>Time.</i>—A
piece of pickled pork weighing 2 lbs.,
1¼ hour; 4 lbs., rather more than 2
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. for the
primest parts. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>PORK PIES (Warwickshire Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—For the crust, 5 lbs. of
lard to 14 lbs. of flour; milk, and water.
For filling the pies, to every 3 lbs. of
meat allow 1 oz. of salt, 2¼ oz. of pepper,
a small quantity of cayenne, 1 pint of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub into the flour a portion
of the lard; the remainder put with
sufficient milk and water to mix the
crust, and boil this gently for ¼ hour.
Pour it boiling on the flour, and knead
and beat it till perfectly smooth. Now
raise the crust in either a round or
oval form, cut up the pork into pieces
the size of a nut, season it in the above
proportion, and press it compactly into
the pie, in alternate layers of fat and
lean, and pour in a small quantity of
water; lay on the lid, cut the edges
smoothly round, and pinch them together.
Bake in a brick oven, which
should be slow, as the meat is very solid.
Very frequently, an inexperienced cook
finds much difficulty in raising the
crust. She should bear in mind that it
must not be allowed to get cold, or it
will fall immediately: to prevent this,
the operation should be performed as
near the fire as possible. As considerable
dexterity and expertness are necessary
to raise the crust with the hand
only, a glass bottle or small jar may be
placed in the middle of the paste, and
the crust moulded on this; but be particular
that it is kept warm the whole
time. <i>Sufficient.</i>—The proportions for 1
pie are 1 lb. of flour and 3 lbs. of meat.
<i>Seasonable</i> from September to March.</p>


<h3>PORK PIES, Little Raised.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of flour, ½ lb. of
butter, ½ lb. of mutton suet, salt and
white pepper to taste, 4 lbs. of the neck
of pork, 1 dessertspoonful of powdered
sage. <i>Mode.</i>—Well dry the flour, mince
the suet, and put these with the butter
into a saucepan, to be made hot, and add
a little salt. When melted, mix it up
into a stiff paste, and put it before the
fire with a cloth over it until ready to
make up; chop the pork into small
pieces, season it with white pepper, salt,
and powdered sage; divide the paste
into rather small pieces, raise it in a
round or oval form, fill with the meat,
and bake in a brick oven. These pies
will require a fiercer oven than those in
the preceding recipe, as they are made
so much smaller, and consequently do
not require so soaking a heat. <i>Time.</i>—If
made small, about 1½ hour. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to March.</p>


<h3>POTATO FRITTERS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 large potatoes, 4 eggs,
2 tablespoonfuls of cream, 2 ditto of
raisin or sweet wine, 1 dessertspoonful
of lemon-juice, ½ teaspoonful of grated
nutmeg, hot lard. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the potatoes,
and beat them up lightly with a
fork, but do not use a spoon, as that
would make them heavy. Beat the eggs
well, leaving out one of the whites; add
the other ingredients, and beat all together
for at least 20 minutes, or until
the batter is extremely light. Put plenty
of good lard into a frying-pan, and drop
a tablespoonful of the batter at a time
into it, and fry the fritters a nice brown.
Serve them with the following sauce:—A
glass of sherry mixed with the strained
juice of a lemon, and sufficient white
sugar to sweeten the whole nicely.
Warm these ingredients, and serve the
sauce separately in a tureen. The fritters
should be neatly dished on a white
d’oyley, and pounded sugar sprinkled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
over them. They should be well drained
on a piece of blotting-paper before
the fire previously to being dished.
<i>Time.</i>—From 6 to 8 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>POTATO PASTY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of rump-steak or
mutton cutlets, pepper and salt to taste,
1/3 pint of weak broth or gravy, 1 oz. of
butter, mashed potatoes. <i>Mode.</i>—Place
the meat, cut in small pieces, at the
bottom of the pan; season it with pepper
and salt, and add the gravy and
butter broken into small pieces. Put on
the perforated plate, with its valve-pipe
screwed on, and fill up the whole space
to the top of the tube with nicely-mashed
potatoes mixed with a little milk, and
finish the surface of them in any ornamental
manner. If carefully baked, the
potatoes will be covered with a delicate
brown crust, retaining all the savoury
steam rising from the meat. Send it to
table as it comes from the oven, with a
napkin folded round it. <i>Time.</i>—40 to 60
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>

<h3>POTATO PUDDING.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of mashed potatoes,
2 oz. of butter, 2 eggs, ¼ pint of milk,
3 tablespoonfuls of sherry, ¼ saltspoonful
of salt, the juice and rind of 1 small
lemon, 2 oz. of sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
sufficient potatoes to make ½ lb. when
mashed; add to these the butter, eggs,
milk, sherry, lemon-juice, and sugar;
mince the lemon-peel very finely, and
beat all the ingredients well together.
Put the pudding into a buttered pie-dish,
and bake for rather more than
½ hour. To enrich it, add a few pounded
almonds, and increase the quantity of
eggs and butter. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour, or
rather longer. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>POTATO RISSOLES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Mashed potatoes, salt
and pepper to taste; when liked, a very
little minced parsley, egg, and bread-crumbs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil and mash the
potatoes; add a seasoning of pepper
and salt, and, when liked, a little minced
parsley. Roll the potatoes into small
balls, cover them with egg and bread-crumbs,
and fry in hot lard for about 10
minutes; let them drain before the fire,
dish them on a napkin, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes to fry the rissoles. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>

<div class="caption">POTATO RISSOLES.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The flavour of these rissoles
may be very much increased by adding
finely-minced tongue or ham, or even
chopped onions, when these are liked.</p>


<h3>POTATO SALAD.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—10 or 12 cold boiled potatoes,
4 tablespoonfuls of tarragon or
plain vinegar, 6 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil,
pepper and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful
of minced parsley. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the
potatoes into slices about ½ inch in thickness;
put these into a salad-bowl with
oil and vinegar in the above proportion;
season with pepper, salt, and a teaspoonful
of minced parsley; stir the salad well,
that all the ingredients may be thoroughly
incorporated, and it is ready to
serve. This should be made two or
three hours before it is wanted for table.
Anchovies, olives, or pickles may be
added to this salad, as also slices of cold
beef, fowl, or turkey. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>POTATO SNOW.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Potatoes, salt, and water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Choose large white potatoes, as
free from spots as possible; boil them in
their skins in salt and water until perfectly
tender; drain and <i>dry them thoroughly</i>
by the side of the fire, and peel
them. Put a hot dish before the fire,
rub the potatoes through a coarse sieve
on to this dish; do not touch them afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
or the flakes will fall, and serve
as hot as possible. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour
to boil the potatoes. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i>
per bushel. <i>Sufficient</i>,—6 potatoes for
3 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>POTATO SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 lbs. of mealy potatoes,
boiled or steamed very dry, pepper and
salt to taste, 2 quarts of stock. <i>Mode.</i>—When
the potatoes are boiled, mash them
smoothly, that no lumps remain, and
gradually put them to the boiling stock;
pass it through a sieve, season, and simmer
for 5 minutes. Skim well, and serve
with fried bread. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>

8 persons.</p>


<h3>POTATO SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of shin of beef,
1 lb. of potatoes, 1 onion, ½ a pint of
peas, 2 oz. of rice, 2 heads of celery,
pepper and salt to taste, 3 quarts of
water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the beef into thin
slices, chop the potatoes and onion, and
put them into a stewpan with the water,
peas, and rice. Stew gently till the
gravy is drawn from the meat; strain it
off, take out the beef, and pulp the other
ingredients through a coarse sieve. Put
the pulp back into the soup, cut up the
celery in it, and simmer till this is tender.
Season, and serve with fried bread cut
into it. <i>Time.</i>—3 hours. <i>Average cost</i>,

<h3>POTATO SOUP (very Economical).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 middle-sized potatoes
well pared, a thick slice of bread, 6 leeks
peeled and cut into thin slices as far as
the white extends upwards from the
roots, a teacupful of rice, a teaspoonful
of salt, and half that of pepper, and 2
quarts of water. <i>Mode.</i>—The water
must be completely boiling before anything
is put into it; then add the whole
of the ingredients at once, with the exception
of the rice, the salt, and the
pepper. Cover, and let these come to a
brisk boil; put in the others, and let
the whole boil slowly for an hour, or till
all the ingredients are thoroughly done,
and their several juices extracted and
mixed. <i>Time.</i>—2½ hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
3<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in winter.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Potatoes. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose
large potatoes, as much of a size
as possible; wash them in lukewarm
water, and scrub them well, for the
browned skin of a baked potato is by
many persons considered the better part
of it. Put them into a moderate oven,
and bake them
for about two
hours, turning
them three or
four times whilst
they are cooking.
Serve them in a
napkin immediately they are done, as, if
kept a long time in the oven, they have
a shrivelled appearance. Potatoes may
also be roasted before the fire, in an
American oven; but when thus cooked,
they must be done very slowly. Do not
forgot to send to table with them a piece
of cold butter. <i>Time.</i>—Large potatoes,
in a hot oven, 1½ hour to 2 hours; in a
cool oven, 2 to 2½ hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
4<i>s.</i> per bushel. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 2 to
each person. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year,
but not good just before and whilst new
potatoes are in season.</p>

IN NAPKIN.</div>
</div>


<h3>POTATOES, to Boil.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—10 or 12 potatoes; to
each ½ gallon of water allow 1 heaped
tablespoonful of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose
potatoes of an equal size, pare them,
take out all the eyes and specks, and as
they are peeled, throw them into cold
water. Put them into a saucepan, with
sufficient <i>cold</i> water to cover them, with
salt in the above proportion, and let
them <i>boil gently</i> until tender. Ascertain
when they are done by thrusting a fork
in them, and take them up the moment
they feel soft through; for if they are
left in the water afterwards, they become
waxy or watery. Drain away the water,
put the saucepan by the side of the fire,
with the lid partially uncovered, to allow
the steam to escape, and let the potatoes
get thoroughly dry, and do not allow
them to get burnt. Their superfluous
moisture will evaporate, and the potatoes,
if a good sort, should be perfectly mealy
and dry. Potatoes vary so much in quality
and size, that it is difficult to give the
exact time for boiling; they should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
attentively watched, and probed with a
fork, to ascertain when they are cooked.
Send them to table quickly, and very hot,
and with an opening in the cover of the
dish, that a portion of the steam may
evaporate, and not fall back on the potatoes.
<i>Time.</i>—Moderate-sized old potatoes,
15 to 20 minutes, after the water
boils; large ones, ½ hour to 35 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> per bushel. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year,
but not good just before and whilst new
potatoes are in season.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—To keep potatoes hot, after
draining the water from them, put a
folded cloth or flannel (kept for the purpose)
on the top of them, keeping the
saucepan-lid partially uncovered. This
will absorb the moisture, and keep them
hot some time without spoiling.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, to Boil in their
Jackets.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—10 or 12 potatoes; to
each ½ gallon of water, allow 1 heaped
tablespoonful of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—To obtain
this wholesome and delicious vegetable
cooked in perfection, it should be boiled
and sent to table with the skin on. In
Ireland, where, perhaps, the cooking of
potatoes is better understood than in any
country, they are always served so.
Wash the potatoes well, and if necessary,
use a clean scrubbing-brush to remove
the dirt from them; and, if possible,
choose the potatoes so that they
may all be as nearly the same size as
possible. When thoroughly cleansed,
fill the saucepan half full with them, and
just cover the potatoes with cold water
salted in the above proportion: they are
more quickly boiled with a small quantity
of water, and, besides, are more
savoury than when drowned in it.
Bring them to boil, then draw the pan
to the side of the fire, and let them
simmer gently until tender. Ascertain
when they are done by probing them
with a fork; then pour off the water,
uncover the saucepan, and let the potatoes
dry by the side of the fire, taking
care not to let them burn. Peel them
quickly, put them in a very hot vegetable-dish,
either with or without a napkin,
and serve very quickly. After potatoes
are cooked, they should never be
entirely covered up, as the steam, instead
of escaping, falls down on them,
and makes them watery and insipid.
In Ireland they are usually served up
with the skins on, and a small plate is
placed by the side of each guest. <i>Time.</i>—Moderate-sized
potatoes, with their
skins on, 20 to 25 minutes after the
water boils; large potatoes, 25 minutes
to ¾ hour, or longer; 5 minutes to dry
them. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> per bushel.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all
the year, but not good just before and
whilst new potatoes are in season.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, New, to Boil.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Potatoes; to each ½ gallon
of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful
of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Do not have the
potatoes dug long before they are
dressed, as they are never good when
they have been out of the ground some
time. Well wash them, rub off the
skins with a coarse cloth, and put them
into <i>boiling</i> water salted in the above
proportion. Let them boil until tender;
try them with a fork, and when done,
pour the water away from them; let
them stand by the side of the fire with
the lid of the saucepan partially uncovered,
and when the potatoes are thoroughly
dry, put them into a hot vegetable-dish,
with a piece of butter the
size of a walnut; pile the potatoes over
this, and serve. If the potatoes are too
old to have the skin rubbed off, boil
them in their jackets; drain, peel, and
serve them as above, with a piece of
butter placed in the midst of them.
<i>Time.</i>—¼ to ½ hour, according to the
size. <i>Average cost</i>, in full season, 1<i>d.</i>
per lb. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 3 lbs. for 5 or
6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in May and June,
but may be had, forced, in March.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, Fried  (French
Fashion).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Potatoes, hot butter or
clarified dripping, salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel
and cut the potatoes into thin slices, as
nearly the same size as possible; make
some butter or dripping <i>hot</i> in a frying-pan;
put in the potatoes, and fry them
on both sides until <i>nearly</i> cooked. Now
take the potatoes out of the fat, make
the fat <i>quite boiling</i>, then throw in the
potatoes for a minute or two until sufficiently
done. The immersion of the
vegetable in the grease a second time
after it is partially cooked, causes it to
puff or “gonfler,” as the French say,
which is the desired appearance for
properly-dressed fried potatoes to possess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
When they are crisp and done,
take them up, place them on a cloth
before the fire to drain the grease from
them, and serve very hot, after sprinkling
them with salt. These are delicious
with rump-steak, and, in France, are
frequently served thus as a breakfast
dish. The remains of cold potatoes may
also be sliced and fried by the above recipe,
but the slices must be cut a little
thicker. <i>Time.</i>—Sliced raw potatoes,
5 minutes; cooked potatoes, 5 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> per bushel. <i>Sufficient</i>,—6
sliced potatoes for 3 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, a German Method of
Cooking.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 to 10 middling-sized
potatoes, 3 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls
of flour, ½ pint of broth, 2 tablespoonfuls
of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the
butter and flour into a stewpan; stir
over the fire until the butter is of a nice
brown colour, and add the broth and
vinegar; peel and cut the potatoes into
long thin slices, lay them in the gravy,
and let them simmer gently until tender,
which will be in from 10 to 15 minutes,
and serve very hot. A laurel-leaf simmered
with the potatoes is an improvement.
<i>Time.</i>—10 to 15 minutes. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, à la Maître d’Hôtel.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Potatoes, salt and water;
to every 6 potatoes allow 1 tablespoonful
of minced parsley, 2 oz. of butter, pepper
and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of
gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the potatoes clean, and
boil them in salt and water; when they
are done, drain them, let them cool;
then peel and cut the potatoes into thick
slices: if these are too thin, they would
break in the sauce. Put the butter into
a stewpan with the pepper, salt, gravy,
and parsley; mix these ingredients well
together, put in the potatoes, shake them
two or three times, that they may be
well covered with the sauce, and, when
quite hot through, squeeze in the lemon-juice,
and serve. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour to
boil the potatoes; 10 minutes for them
to heat in the sauce. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i>
per bushel. <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, Mashed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Potatoes; to every lb. of
mashed potatoes allow 1 oz. of butter, 2
tablespoonfuls of milk, salt to taste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil the potatoes in their skins;
when done, drain them, and let them get
thoroughly dry by the side of the fire;
then peel them, and, as they are peeled,
put them into a clean saucepan, and with
a <i>large fork</i> beat them to a light paste;
add butter, milk, and salt in the above
proportion, and stir all the ingredients
well over the fire. When thoroughly
hot, dish them lightly, and draw the
fork backwards over the potatoes to
make the surface rough, and serve.
When dressed in this manner, they may
be browned at the top with a salamander,
or before the fire. Some cooks press the
potatoes into moulds, then turn them
out, and brown them in the oven: this
is a pretty mode of serving, but it makes
them heavy. In whatever way they are
sent to table, care must be taken to have
them quite free from lumps. <i>Time.</i>—From
½ to ¾ hour to boil the potatoes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> per bushel. <i>Sufficient</i>,—1
lb. of mashed potatoes for 3 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, Very Thin-mashed,
or, Purée de Pommes de Terre.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of mashed
potatoes allow ¼ pint of good broth or
stock, 2 oz. of butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the
potatoes, well drain them, and pound
them smoothly in a mortar, or beat them
up with a fork; add the stock or broth,
and rub the potatoes through a sieve.
Put the purée into a very clean saucepan
with the butter; stir it well over
the fire until thoroughly hot, and it will
then be ready to serve. A purée should
be rather thinner than mashed potatoes,
and is a delicious accompaniment to
delicately broiled mutton cutlets. Cream
or milk may be substituted for the broth
when the latter is not at hand. A casserole
of potatoes, which is often used for
ragoûts instead of rice, is made by mashing
potatoes rather thickly, placing them
on a dish, and making an opening in the
centre. After having browned the potatoes
in the oven, the dish should be
wiped clean, and the ragoût or fricassée
poured in. <i>Time.</i>—About ½ hour to boil
the potatoes; 6 or 7 minutes to warm the
purée. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> per bushel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1 lb. of cooked potatoes
for 3 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, how to use Cold.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold potatoes;
to every lb. allow 2 tablespoonfuls
of flour, 2 ditto of minced onions,
1 oz. of buttermilk. <i>Mode.</i>—Mash the
potatoes with a fork until perfectly free
from lumps; stir in the other ingredients,
and add sufficient milk to moisten
them well; press the potatoes into a
mould, and bake in a moderate oven
until nicely brown, which will be in from
20 minutes to ½ hour. Turn them out
of the mould, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes to ½ hour. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>POTATOES, to Steam.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Potatoes; boiling water.
<i>Mode.</i>—This mode of cooking potatoes is
now much in vogue, particularly where
they are wanted on a large scale, it being
so very convenient. Pare the potatoes,
throw them into cold water as they are
peeled, then put them into a steamer.
Place the steamer over a saucepan of
boiling water, and steam the potatoes
from 20 to 40 minutes, according to the
size and sort. When a fork goes easily
through them, they are done; then
take them up, dish, and serve very
quickly. <i>Time.</i>—20 to 40 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 4<i>s.</i> per bushel. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
2 large potatoes to each person.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year, but not so good
whilst new potatoes are in season.</p>


<h3>POULET AUX CRESSONS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A fowl, a large bunch of
water-cresses, 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar,
¼ pint of gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Truss and
roast a fowl by recipe, taking care that
it is nicely frothed and brown. Wash
and dry the water-cresses, pick them
nicely, and arrange them in a flat layer
on a dish. Sprinkle over a little salt
and the above proportion of vinegar;
place over these the fowl, and pour over
it the gravy. A little gravy should be
served in a tureen. When not liked,
the vinegar may be omitted. <i>Time.</i>—From
½ to 1 hour, according to size.
<i>Average cost</i>, in full season, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each.

<h3>POUND CAKE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 209px;">
<img src="images/illus-267.jpg" width="209" height="87" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">POUND CAKE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of butter, 1¼ lb. of
flour, 1 lb. of pounded loaf sugar, 1 lb. of
currants, 9 eggs, 2 oz. of candied peel, ½ oz.
of citron, ½ oz. of sweet almonds; when
liked, a little pounded mace. <i>Mode.</i>—Work
the butter to a cream; dredge in
the flour; add the sugar, currants, candied
peel, which should be cut into neat
slices, and the almonds, which should be
blanched and chopped, and mix all these
well together;
whisk the eggs,
and let them be
thoroughly
blended with the
dry ingredients.
Beat the cake well for 20 minutes, and put
it into a round tin, lined at the bottom and
sides with a strip of white buttered paper.
Bake it from 1½ to 2 hours, and let the
oven be well heated when the cake is
first put in, as, if this is not the case,
the currants will all sink to the bottom
of it. To make this preparation light,
the yolks and whites of the eggs should
be beaten separately, and added separately
to the other ingredients. A glass
of wine is sometimes added to the mixture;
but this is scarcely necessary, as
the cake will be found quite rich enough
without it. <i>Time.</i>—1½ to 2 hours. <i>Ave-</i>*<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
<i>rage cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—The above
quantity divided in two will make two
nice-sized cakes. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>PRAWN SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Two quarts of fish stock,
two pints of prawns, the crumb of a
French roll, anchovy sauce or mushroom
ketchup to taste, one blade of mace, one-fourth
pint of vinegar, a little lemon-juice.
<i>Mode.</i>—Pick out the tails of the
prawns, put the bodies in a stewpan
with 1 blade of mace, ¼ pint of vinegar,
and the same quantity of water; stew
them for ¼ hour, and strain off the liquor.
Put the fish stock into a stewpan; add
the strained liquor, pound the prawns
with the crumb of a roll moistened with
a little of the soup, rub them through a
tammy, and mix them by degrees with
the soup; add ketchup or anchovy sauce
to taste with a little lemon-juice. When
it is well cooked, put in a few picked
prawns; let them get thoroughly hot,
and serve. If not thick enough, put in a
little butter and flour. <i>Time.</i>—Hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This can be thickened with
tomatoes, and vermicelli served in it,
which makes it a very tasteful soup.</p>


<h3>PRAWNS, to Dress.</h3>

<p>Cover a dish with a large cup reversed,
and over that lay a small white napkin.
Arrange the prawns on it in the form of
a pyramid, and garnish with plenty of
parsley. Sometimes prawns are stuck
into a lemon cut in half the long way,
and garnished with parsley.</p>


<h3>PRESERVES.</h3>

<p>From the nature of vegetable substances,
and chiefly from their not passing
so rapidly into the putrescent state
as animal bodies, the mode of preserving
them is somewhat different, although the
general principles are the same. All
the means of preservation are put in
practice occasionally for fruits and the
various parts of vegetables, according to
the nature of the species, the climate,
the uses to which they are applied, &amp;c.
Some are dried, as nuts, raisins, sweet
herbs, &amp;c.; others are preserved by
means of sugar, such as many fruits
whose delicate juices would be lost by
drying; some are preserved by means
of vinegar, and chiefly used as condiments
or pickles; a few also by salting,
as French beans; while others are preserved
in spirits. We have, however, in
this place to treat of the best methods
of preserving fruits. Fruit is a most
important item in the economy of health;
the epicurean can scarcely be said to
have any luxuries without it; therefore,
as it is so invaluable, when we cannot
have it fresh, we must have it preserved.
It has long been a desideratum to preserve
fruits by some cheap method, yet
by such as would keep them fit for the
various culinary purposes, as making
tarts and other similar dishes. The expense
of preserving them with sugar is a
serious objection; for, except the sugar
be used in considerable quantities, the
success is very uncertain. Sugar also
overpowers and destroys the sub-acid
taste so desirable in many fruits: those
which are preserved in this manner are
chiefly intended for the dessert. Fruits
intended for preservation should be
gathered in the morning, in dry weather,
with, the morning sun upon them, if possible;
they will then have their fullest
flavour, and keep in good condition
longer than when gathered at any other
time. Until fruit can be used, it should
be placed in the dairy, an ice-house, or a
refrigerator. In an ice-house it will remain
fresh and plump for several days.
Fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather
will soon be mildewed, and be of no service
for preserves.</p>

<p>Having secured the first and most important
contribution to the manufacture
of preserves—the fruit, the next consideration
is the preparation of the syrup
in which the fruit is to be suspended;
and this requires much care. In the
confectioner’s art there is a great nicety
in proportioning the degree of concentration
of the syrup very exactly to each
particular case; and he knows this by
signs, and expresses it by certain technical
terms. But to distinguish these properly
requires very great attention and considerable
experience. The principal
thing to be acquainted with is the fact,
that, in proportion as the syrup is longer
boiled, its water will become evaporated,
and its consistency will be thicker. Great
care must be taken in the management
of the fire, that the syrup does not boil
over, and that the boiling is not carried
to such an extent as to burn the sugar.</p>

<p>The first degree or consistency is called
<i>the thread</i>, which is subdivided into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
little and great thread. If you dip the
finger into the syrup and apply it to the
thumb, the tenacity of the syrup will,
on separating the finger and thumb,
afford a thread, which shortly breaks:
this is the little thread. If the thread,
from the greater tenacity, and, consequently,
greater strength of the syrup,
admits of a greater extension of the
finger and thumb, it is called the great
thread. There are half-a-dozen other
terms and experiments for testing the
various thickness of the boiling sugar
towards the consistency called <i>caramel</i>;
but that degree of sugar-boiling belongs
to the confectioner. A solution of sugar
prepared by dissolving two parts of
double-refined sugar (the best sugar is
the most economical for preserves) in
one of water, and boiling this a little,
affords a syrup of the right degree of
strength, and which neither ferments
nor crystallizes. This appears to be the
degree called <i>smooth</i> by the confectioners,
and is proper to be used for the purposes
of preserves. The syrup employed
should sometimes be clarified, which is
done in the following manner:—Dissolve
2 lbs. of loaf sugar in a pint of water;
add to this solution the white of an egg,
and beat it well. Put the preserving-pan
upon the fire with the solution; stir it
with a wooden spatula, and when it begins
to swell and boil up, throw in some cold
water or a little oil to damp the boiling;
for, as it rises suddenly, if it should boil
over, it would take fire, being of a very
inflammable nature. Let it boil up
again; then take it off, and remove carefully
the scum that has risen. Boil the
solution again, throw in a little more
cold water, remove the scum, and so on
for three or four times successively; then
strain it. It is considered to be sufficiently
boiled when some taken up in a
spoon pours out like oil.</p>

<p>Although sugar passes so easily into
the state of fermentation, and is, in fact,
the only substance capable of undergoing
the vinous stage of that process, yet it
will not ferment at all if the quantity be
sufficient to constitute a very strong
syrup: hence, syrups are used to preserve
fruits and other vegetable substances
from the changes they would
undergo if left to themselves. Before
sugar was in use, honey was employed to
preserve many vegetable productions,
though this substance has now given
way to the juice of the sugar-cane.</p>

<p>The fruits that are the most fit for
preservation in syrup are apricots,
peaches, nectarines, apples, greengages,
plums of all kinds, and pears. As an
example, take some apricots not too
ripe, make a small slit at the stem end,
and push out the stone; simmer them
in water till they are softened and about
half done, and afterwards throw them
into cold water. When they have cooled,
take them out and drain them. Put the
apricots into the preserving-pan with
sufficient syrup to cover them; let them
boil up three or four times, and then
skim them; remove them from the fire,
pour them into an earthen pan, and let
them cool till next day. Boil them up
three days successively, skimming each
time, and they will then be finished and
in a fit state to be put into pots for use.
After each boiling, it is proper to examine
into the state of the syrup when
cold; if too thin, it will bear additional
boiling; if too thick, it may be lowered
with more syrup of the visual standard.
The reason why the fruit is emptied out
of the preserving-pan into an earthen
pan is, that the acid of the fruit acts
upon the copper, of which the preserving-pans
are usually made. From this example
the process of preserving fruits
by syrup will be easily comprehended.
The first object is to soften the fruit by
blanching or boiling it in water, in order
that the syrup by which it is preserved
may penetrate through its substance.</p>

<p>Many fruits, when preserved by boiling,
lose much of their peculiar and delicate
flavour, as, for instance, pineapples;
and this inconvenience may, in some instances,
be remedied by preserving them
without heat. Cut the fruit in slices
about one-fifth of an inch thick, strew
powdered loaf sugar an eighth of an inch
thick on the bottom of a jar, and put the
slices on it. Put more sugar on this,
and then another layer of the slices, and
so on till the jar is full. Place the jar
with the fruit up to the neck in boiling
water, and keep it there till the sugar is
completely dissolved, which may take
half-an-hour, removing the scum as it
rises. Lastly, tie a wet bladder over
the mouth of the jar, or cork and wax
it.</p>

<p>Any of the fruits that have been preserved
in syrup may be converted into
dry preserves, by first draining them
from the syrup, and then drying them in
a stove or very moderate oven, adding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to them a quantity of powdered loaf-sugar,
which will gradually penetrate
the fruit, while the fluid parts of the
fruit gently evaporate. They should be
dried in the stove or oven on a sieve, and
turned every six or eight hours, fresh
powdered sugar being sifted over them
every time they are turned. Afterwards,
they are to be kept in a dry situation, in
drawers or boxes. Currants and cherries
preserved whole in this manner, in
bunches, are extremely elegant, and have
a fine flavour. In this way it is, also,
that orange and lemon chips are preserved.</p>

<p>Marmalades, jams, and fruit pastes
are of the same nature, and are now in
very general request. They are prepared
without difficulty, by attending to a very
few directions; they are somewhat expensive,
but may be kept without spoiling
for a considerable time. Marmalades
and jams differ little from each other:
they are preserves of a half-liquid consistency,
made by boiling the pulp of
fruits, and sometimes part of the rinds,
with sugar. The appellation of marmalade
is applied to those confitures which
are composed of the firmer fruits, as
pineapples or the rinds of oranges;
whereas jams are made of the more
juicy berries, such as strawberries, raspberries,
currants, mulberries, &amp;c. Fruit
pastes are a kind of marmalades, consisting
of the pulp of fruits, first evaporated
to a proper consistency, and afterwards
boiled with sugar. The mixture
is then poured into a mould, or spread
on sheets of tin, and subsequently dried
in the oven or stove till it has acquired
the state of a paste. From a sheet of
this paste, strips may be cut and formed
into any shape that may be desired, as
knots, rings, &amp;c. Jams require the
same care and attention in the boiling
as marmalade; the slightest degree of
burning communicates a disagreeable
empyreumatic taste, and if they are not
boiled sufficiently, they will not keep.
That they may keep, it is necessary not
to be sparing of sugar.</p>

<p>In all the operations for preserve-making,
when the preserving-pan is
used, it should not be placed on the
fire, but on a trivet, unless the jam be
made on a hot plate, when this is not
necessary. If the pan be placed close on
to the fire, the preserve is very liable
to burn, and the colour and flavour be
consequently spoiled.</p>

<p>Fruit jellies are compounds of the
juices of fruits combined with sugar,
concentrated, by boiling, to such a consistency
that the liquid, upon cooling,
assumes the form of a tremulous jelly.</p>

<p>Before fruits are candied, they must
first be boiled in syrup, after which they
are taken out and dried on a stove, or
before the fire; the syrup is then to be
concentrated, or boiled to a candy height,
and the fruit dipped in it, and again laid
on the stove to dry and candy; they are
then to be put into boxes, and kept
dry.</p>

<p>Conserves consist of fresh vegetable
matters beat into a uniform mass with
refined sugar, and they are intended to
preserve the virtues and properties of
recent flowers, leaves, roots, peels, or
fruits, unaltered, and as near as possible
to what they were when fresh gathered,
and to give them an agreeable taste.</p>

<p>The last to be mentioned, but not the
least important preparation of fruit, is
the compôte, which can be made at the
moment of need, and with much less
sugar than would be ordinarily put to
preserves. Compôtes are very wholesome
things, suitable to most stomachs
which cannot accommodate themselves
to raw fruit or a large portion of sugar.
They are the happy medium—far better
than ordinary stewed fruit.</p>


<h3>PTARMIGAN, the, or White
Grouse.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/illus-270.jpg" width="351" height="244" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">THE PTARMIGAN.</div>
</div>

<p>This bird is nearly the same size as
red grouse, and is fond of lofty situations,
where it braves the severest
weather, and is found in most parts of
Europe, as well as in Greenland. At
Hudson’s Bay they appear in such multitudes
that so many as sixty or seventy
are frequently taken at once in a net.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
As they are as tame as chickens, this is
done without difficulty. Buffon says that
the ptarmigan avoids the solar heat, and
prefers the frosts of the summits of the
mountains; for, as the snow melts on
the sides of the mountains, it ascends
till it gains the top, where it makes a
hole, and burrows in the snow. In
winter, it flies in flocks, and feeds on
the wild vegetation of the hills, which
imparts to its flesh a bitter, but not
altogether an unpalatable taste. It is
dark-coloured, has something of the
flavour of the hare, and is greatly relished
and much sought after by some sportsmen.</p>


<h3>PTARMIGAN, to Dress the.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 or 3 birds; butter,
flour, fried bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—The
ptarmigan, or white grouse, when young
and tender, are exceedingly fine eating,
and should be kept as long as possible,
to be good. Pluck, draw, and truss
them in the same manner as grouse, and
roast them before a brisk fire. Flour
and froth them nicely, and serve on
buttered toast, with a tureen of brown
gravy. Bread sauce, when liked, may
be sent to table with them, and fried
bread-crumbs substituted for the toasted
bread. <i>Time.</i>—About ½ hour. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2
for a dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from the beginning
of February to the end of
April.</p>


<h3>PTARMIGAN, to Carve.</h3>

5 eggs, a little grated lemon-rind. <i>Mode.</i>—Make

out a portion of the inside with the
point of a knife, and putting into the
cavity a little whipped cream or delicate
preserve, such as apricot, greengage, or
very bright marmalade. The paste for
these puddings requires a great deal of
mixing, as the more it is beaten, the

minutes, and pour it into a shallow tin,
which has been previously well rubbed
with beef dripping. Put the pudding
into the oven, and bake it for an hour;
then, for another ½ hour, place it under
the meat, to catch a little of the gravy
that flows from it. Cut the pudding

<h3>PUFF-PASTE RINGS, or Puits
d’Amour.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Puff-paste (<i>see</i> <a href="#PASTE_Puff">Paste</a>), the
white of an egg, sifted loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
some good puff-paste by recipe;
roll it out to the thickness of about
¼ inch, and, with a round fluted paste-cutter,
stamp out as many pieces as may
be required; then work the paste up
again, and roll it out to the same thickness,
and with a <i>smaller</i> cutter, stamp
out sufficient pieces to correspond with
the larger ones. Again stamp out the
centre of these smaller rings; brush
over the others with the white of an egg,
place a small ring on the top of every
large circular piece of paste, egg over
the tops, and bake from 15 to 20 minutes.
Sift over sugar, put them back in the
oven to colour them; then fill the rings
with preserve of any bright colour. Dish
them high on a napkin, and serve. So
many pretty dishes of pastry may be
made by stamping puff-paste out with
fancy cutters, and filling the pieces, when
baked, with jelly or preserve, that our
space will not allow us to give a separate
recipe for each of them; but as they are
all made from one paste, and only the
shape and garnishing varied, perhaps it
is not necessary, and by exercising a
little ingenuity, variety may always be
obtained. Half-moons, leaves, diamonds,
stars, shamrocks, rings, &amp;c., are the
most appropriate shapes for fancy pastry.
<i>Time.</i>—15 to 25 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
with ½ lb. of paste, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 2
dishes of pastry. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>PUMPKIN, Preserved.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each lb. of pumpkin
allow 1 lb. of roughly pounded loaf
sugar, 1 gill of lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Obtain
a good sweet pumpkin; halve it,
take out the seeds, and pare off the
rind; cut it into neat slices, or into
pieces about the size of a five-shilling
piece. Weigh the pumpkin, put the
slices in a pan or deep dish in layers,
with the sugar sprinkled between them;
pour the lemon-juice over the top, and
let the whole remain for 2 or 3 days.
Boil altogether, adding ½ pint of water
to every 3 lbs. of sugar used, until the
pumpkin becomes tender; then turn
the whole into a pan, where let it remain
for a week; then drain off the
syrup, boil it until it is quite thick;
skim, and pour it, boiling, over the
pumpkin. A little bruised ginger and
lemon-rind, thinly pared, may be boiled
in the syrup to flavour the pumpkin.
<i>Time.</i>—From ½ to ¾ hour to boil the
pumpkin tender. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> to
7<i>d.</i> per lb. pot. <i>Seasonable</i> in September
and October; but better when made in
the latter month, as the pumpkin is then
quite ripe.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—-Vegetable marrows are very
good prepared in the same manner, but
are not quite so rich.</p>


<h3>PUNCH, to make Hot.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of rum, ½ pint of
brandy, ¼ lb. of sugar, 1 large lemon, ½
teaspoonful of nutmeg, 1 pint of boiling

together, add the rum, brandy, and
nutmeg; mix thoroughly, and the punch
will be ready to serve. It is very important
in making good punch that all
the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated;
and to insure success, the processes
of mixing must be diligently
attended to. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow a quart
for 4 persons; but this information must
be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>; for the capacities
of persons for this kind of beverage
are generally supposed to vary
considerably.</p>


<h3>QUAILS, to Dress.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Quails, butter, toast.
<i>Mode.</i>—These birds keep good several
days, and should be roasted without
drawing. Truss them in the same manner
as woodcocks; roast them before a
clear fire, keep them well basted, and
serve on toast. <i>Time.</i>—About 20 minutes.
<i>Average cost.</i>—Seldom bought.
<i>Sufficient</i>, 2 for a dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from
October to December.</p>


<h3>QUAILS.</h3>

<p>Quails, being trussed and served like
Woodcock, may be similarly carved.</p>


<h3>QUINCE JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every pint of juice
allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare
and slice the quinces, and put them
into a preserving-pan with sufficient
water to float them. Boil them until
tender, and the fruit is reduced to a
pulp; strain off the clear juice, and to
each pint allow the above proportion of
loaf sugar. Boil the juice and sugar
together for about ¾ hour; remove all
the scum as it rises, and if the jelly appears
firm when a little is poured on a
plate, it is done. The residue left on the
sieve will answer to make a common
marmalade, for immediate use, by boiling
it with ½ lb. of common sugar to
every lb. of pulp. <i>Time.</i>—3 hours to
boil the quinces in water; ¾ hour to boil
the jelly. <i>Average cost</i>, from 8<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i>
per lb. pot. <i>Seasonable</i> from August to
October.</p>


<h3>QUINCE MARMALADE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of quince
pulp allow ¾ lb. of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice
the quinces into a preserving-pan,
adding sufficient water for them to float;
place them on the fire to stew, until
reduced to a pulp, keeping them stirred
occasionally from the bottom, to prevent
their burning; then pass the pulp
through a hair sieve, to keep back the
skin and seeds. Weigh the pulp, and to
each lb. add lump sugar in the above
proportion, broken very small. Place
the whole on the fire, and keep it well
stirred from the bottom of the pan with
a wooden spoon, until reduced to a marmalade,
which may be known by dropping
a little on a cold plate, when, if it
jellies, it is done. Put it into jars whilst
hot; let it cool, and cover with pieces of
oiled paper cut to the size of the mouths
of the jars. The tops of them may be
afterwards covered with pieces of bladder,
or tissue-paper brushed over on both
sides with the white of an egg. <i>Time.</i>—3
hours to boil the quinces without the
sugar; ¾ hour to boil the pulp with the
sugar. <i>Average cost</i>, from 8<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i> per
lb. pot. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1 pint of
sliced quinces for a lb. pot. <i>Seasonable</i>
in August, September, and October.</p>

<img src="images/illus-278.jpg" width="245" height="98" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">BOILED RABBIT.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Rabbit; water. <i>Mode.</i>—For
boiling, choose rabbits with smooth
and sharp claws, as that denotes they are
young: should these be blunt and
rugged, the ears dry and tough, the
animal is old. After emptying and
skinning it, wash it well in cold water,
and let it soak for about ¼ hour in warm
water, to draw out the blood. Bring
the head round to the side, and fasten it
there by means of a skewer run through
that and the body. Put the rabbit into
sufficient hot water to cover it, let it
boil very gently until tender, which will
be in from ½ to ¾ hour, according to its
size and age. Dish it, and smother it
either with onion, mushroom, or liver-sauce,
or parsley-and-butter; the former
is, however, generally preferred to any
of the last-named sauces. When liver-sauce
is preferred, the liver should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
boiled for a few minutes, and minced
very finely, or rubbed through a sieve
before it is added to the sauce. <i>Time.</i>—A
very young rabbit, ½ hour; a large one,
¾ hour; an old one, 1 hour or longer.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
September to February.</p>


<h3>RABBIT, Curried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 rabbit, 2 oz. of butter,
3 onions, 1 pint of stock, 1 tablespoonful
of curry powder, 1 tablespoonful of flour,
1 tablespoonful of mushroom powder,
the juice of ½ lemon, ½ lb. of rice. <i>Mode.</i>—Empty,
skin, and wash the rabbit
thoroughly, and cut it neatly into joints.
Put it into a stewpan with the butter
and sliced onions, and let them acquire a
nice brown colour, but do not allow
them to blacken. Pour in the stock,
which should be boiling; mix the curry
powder and flour smoothly with a little
water, add it to the stock, with the
mushroom powder, and simmer gently
for rather more than ½ hour; squeeze in
the lemon-juice, and serve in the centre
of a dish, with an edging of boiled rice
all round. Where economy is studied,
water may be substituted for the stock;
in this case, the meat and onions must be
very nicely browned. A little sour apple
and rasped cocoa-nut stewed with the
curry will be found a great improvement.
<i>Time.</i>—Altogether ¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in winter.</p>


<h3>RABBIT, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 rabbit, flour, dripping,
1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of minced
shalot, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom
ketchup. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the rabbit into
neat joints, and flour them well;
make the dripping boil in a frying-pan,
put in the rabbit, and fry it a nice brown.
Have ready a very hot dish, put in the
butter, shalot, and ketchup; arrange
the rabbit pyramidically on this, and
serve as quickly as possible. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to February.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The rabbit may be brushed over
with egg, and sprinkled with bread-crumbs,
and fried as above. When
cooked in this manner, make a gravy in
the pan, and pour it round, but not over
the pieces of rabbit.</p>


<h3>RABBIT, à la Minute.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 rabbit, ¼ lb. of butter,
salt and pepper to taste, 2 blades of

tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, 2
teaspoonfuls of flour, 2 glasses of
sherry, 1 pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Empty,
skin, and wash the rabbit thoroughly,
and cut it into joints. Put the butter
into a stewpan with the pieces of rabbit;
add salt, pepper, and pounded mace,
and let it cook until three parts done;
then put in the remaining ingredients,
and boil for about 10 minutes; it will
then be ready to serve. Fowls or hare
may be dressed in the same manner.
<i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 35 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>

<h3>RABBIT PIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 rabbit, a few slices of
ham, salt and white pepper to taste,
2 blades of pounded mace, ½ teaspoonful
of grated nutmeg, a few forcemeat balls,
3 hard-boiled eggs, ½ pint of gravy, puff
crust. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the rabbit (which
should be young), remove the breastbone,
and bone the legs. Put the rabbit,
slices of ham, forcemeat balls, and hard
eggs, by turns, in layers, and season each
layer with pepper, salt, pounded mace,
and grated nutmeg. Pour in about ½
pint of water, cover with crust, and bake
in a well-heated oven for about 1½ hour.
Should the crust acquire too much
colour, place a piece of paper over it to
prevent it from burning. When done,
pour in at the top, by means of the hole
in the middle of the crust, a little good
gravy, which may be made of the breast- and
leg-bones of the rabbit, and 2 or 3
shank-bones, flavoured with onion, herbs,
and spices. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to February.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The liver of the rabbit may be
boiled, minced, and mixed with the
forcemeat balls, when the flavour is
liked.</p>


<h3>RABBIT OR HARE, Ragoût of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 rabbit, 3 teaspoonfuls
of flour, 3 sliced onions, 2 oz. of butter,
a few thin slices of bacon, pepper and
salt to taste, 2 slices of lemon, 1 bay-leaf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
1 glass of port wine. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice the
onions, and put them into a stewpan
with the flour and butter; place the pan
near the fire, stir well as the butter
melts, till the onions become a rich
brown colour, and add, by degrees, a
little water or gravy till the mixture is
of the consistency of cream. Cut some
thin slices of bacon; lay in these with
the rabbit, cut into neat joints; add a
seasoning of pepper and salt, the lemon
and bay-leaf, and let the whole simmer
until tender. Pour in the port wine,
give one boil, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—About
½ hour to simmer the rabbit. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
September to February.</p>


<h3>RABBIT, Roast or Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 rabbit, forcemeat,
buttered paper, sausage-meat. <i>Mode.</i>—Empty,
skin, and thoroughly wash the
rabbit; wipe it dry, line the inside with
sausage-meat and forcemeat, and to
which has been added the minced liver.
Sew the stuffing inside, skewer back the
head between the shoulders, cut off the
fore-joints of the shoulders and legs,
bring them close to the body, and secure
them by means of a skewer. Wrap the
rabbit in buttered paper, and put it
down to a bright clear fire; keep it well
basted and a few minutes before it is
done remove the paper, flour and froth
it, and let it acquire a nice brown colour.
Take out the skewers, and serve with
brown gravy and red-currant jelly. To
bake the rabbit, proceed in the same
manner as above; in a good oven, it will
take about the same time as roasting.
<i>Time.</i>—A young rabbit, 35 minutes; a
large one about ¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4

<h3>RABBIT SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 large rabbits, or 3
small ones; a faggot of savoury herbs,
½ head of celery, 2 carrots, 1 onion, 1
blade of mace, salt and white pepper to
taste, a little pounded mace, ½ pint of
cream, the yolks of 2 eggs boiled hard,
the crumb of a French roll, nearly 3 quarts
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Make the soup with
the legs and shoulders of the rabbit, and
keep the nice pieces for a dish or <i>entrée</i>.
Put them into warm water, and draw
the blood; when quite clean, put them
into a stewpan, with a faggot of herbs,
and a teacupful, or rather more, of veal
stock or water. Simmer slowly till done
through, add the three quarts of water,
and boil for an hour. Take out the
rabbit, pick the meat from the bones,
covering it up to keep it white; put the
bones back in the liquor, add the vegetables,
and simmer for two hours; skim
and strain, and let it cool. Now pound
the meat in a mortar, with the yolks of
the eggs, and the crumb of the roll previously
soaked; rub it through a tammy,
and gradually add it to the strained
liquor, and simmer for 15 minutes. Mix
arrowroot or rice-flour with the cream
(say 2 dessertspoonfuls), and stir in the
soup; bring it to a boil, and serve. This
soup must be very white, and instead of
thickening it with arrowroot or rice-flour,
vermicelli or pearl barley can be boiled
in a little stock, and put in five minutes
before serving. <i>Time.</i>—Nearly 4 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
from September to March. <i>Sufficient</i> for
10 persons.</p>


<h3>RABBIT, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 rabbit, 2 large onions,
6 cloves, 1 small teaspoonful of chopped
lemon-peel, a few forcemeat balls,
thickening of butter and flour, 1 large
tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut the rabbit into small joints;
put them into a stewpan, add the onions
sliced, the cloves, and minced lemon-peel.
Pour in sufficient water to cover
the meat, and, when the rabbit is nearly
done, drop in a few forcemeat balls, to
which has been added the liver, finely
chopped. Thicken the gravy with flour
and butter, put in the ketchup, give one
boil, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—Rather more
than ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from September to February.</p>


<h3>RABBIT STEWED, Larded.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 rabbit, a few strips of
bacon, rather more than 1 pint of good
broth or stock, a bunch of savoury
herbs, salt and pepper to taste, thickening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of butter and flour, 1 glass of sherry.
<i>Mode.</i>—Well wash the rabbit, cut it into
quarters, lard them with slips of bacon,
and fry them; then put them into a
stewpan with the broth, herbs, and a
seasoning of pepper and salt; simmer
gently until the rabbit is tender, then
strain the gravy, thicken it with butter
and flour, add the sherry, let it boil,
pour it over the rabbit, and serve.
Garnish with slices of cut lemon. <i>Time.</i>—Rather
more than ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September to
February.</p>


<h3>RABBITS, Stewed in Milk.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 very young rabbits,
not nearly half grown; 1½ pint of milk,
1 blade of mace, 1 dessertspoonful of
flour, a little salt and cayenne. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix
the flour very smoothly with 4 tablespoonfuls
of the milk, and when this is
well mixed, add the remainder. Cut up
the rabbits into joints, put them into a
stewpan, with the milk and other ingredients,
and simmer them <i>very gently</i>
until quite tender. Stir the contents
from time to time, to keep the milk
smooth and prevent it from burning.
½ hour will be sufficient for the cooking
of this dish. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from September
to February.</p>


<h3>RABBITS, to carve.</h3>

<p>In carving a boiled rabbit, let the
knife be drawn on each side of the backbone,
the whole length of the rabbit, as
shown by the dotted line 3 to 4: thus
the rabbit will be in three parts. Now
let the back be divided into two equal
parts in the direction of the line from 1
to 2; then let the leg be taken off, as
shown by the line 5 to 6, and the
shoulder, as shown by the line 7 to 8.
This, in our opinion, is the best
plan to carve a rabbit, although there
are other modes which are preferred by
some.</p>

<div class="caption">BOILED RABBIT.</div>
</div>

<p>A roast rabbit is rather differently
trussed from one that is meant to be
boiled; but the carving is nearly similar,
as will be seen by the cut. The back should
be divided into as many pieces as it will
give, and the legs and shoulders can then
be disengaged in the same manner as
those of the boiled animal.</p>

<h3>RAISED PIE, of Poultry or Game.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour
allow ½ lb of butter, ½ pint of water, the
yolks of 2 eggs, ½ teaspoonful of salt
(these are for the crust); 1 large fowl or
pheasant, a few slices of veal cutlet, a
few slices of dressed ham, forcemeat,
seasoning of nutmeg, allspice, pepper
and salt, gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a stiff
short crust with the above proportion of
butter, flour, water, and eggs, and work
it up very smoothly; butter a raised-pie
mould, and line it with paste. Previously
to making the crust, bone the fowl, or
whatever bird is intended to be used, lay
it, breast downwards, upon a cloth, and
season the inside well with pounded
mace, allspice, pepper, and salt; then
spread over it a layer of forcemeat, then
a layer of seasoned veal, and then one of
ham, and then another layer of forcemeat,
and roll the fowl over, making
the skin meet at the back. Line the pie
with forcemeat, put in the fowl, and fill
up the cavities with slices of seasoned
veal, and ham, and forcemeat; wet the
edges of the pie, put on the cover, pinch
the edges together with the paste-pincers,
and decorate it with leaves;
brush it over with beaten yolk of egg,
and bake in a moderate oven for 4 hours.
In the mean time, make a good strong
gravy from the bones, pour it through
a funnel into the hole at the top; cover
this hole with a small leaf, and the pie,
when cold, will be ready for use. Let it
be remembered that the gravy must be
considerably reduced before it is poured
into the pie, as, when cold, it should
form a firm jelly, and not be the least
degree in a liquid state. This recipe is
suitable for all kinds of poultry or game,
using one or more birds, according to
the size of the pie intended to be made;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
but the birds must always be boned.
Truffles, mushrooms, &amp;c., added to this
pie, make it much nicer; and, to enrich
it, lard the fleshy parts of the poultry or
game with thin strips of bacon. This
method of forming raised pies in a mould
is generally called a <i>timbale</i>, and has the
advantage of being more easily made
than one where the paste is raised by
the hands; the crust, besides, being
eatable. <i>Time.</i>—Large pie, 4 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>, with
poultry, all the year; with game, from
September to March.</p>


<h3>RAISED PIE, of Veal and Ham.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 or 4 lbs. of veal cutlets,
a few slices of bacon or ham, seasoning
of pepper, salt, nutmeg, and allspice,
forcemeat, 2 lbs. of hot-water paste, ½
pint of good strong gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—To
raise the crust for a pie with the hands
is a very difficult task, and can only be
accomplished by skilled and experienced
cooks. The process should be seen to
be satisfactorily learnt, and plenty of
practice given to the making of raised
pies, as by that means only will success
be insured. Make a hot-water paste by
recipe, and from the mass raise the pie
with the hands; if this cannot be accomplished,
cut out pieces for the top and
bottom, and a long piece for the sides;
fasten the bottom and side-piece together
by means of egg, and pinch the edges
well together; then line the pie with
forcemeat, put in a layer of veal, and a
plentiful seasoning of salt, pepper,
nutmeg, and allspice; for, let it be remembered,
these pies taste very insipid
unless highly seasoned. Over the seasoning
place a layer of sliced bacon or
cooked ham, and then a layer of forcemeat,
veal seasoning, and bacon, and so
on until the meat rises to about an inch
above the paste; taking care to finish
with a layer of forcemeat, to fill all the
cavities of the pie, and to lay in the meat
firmly and compactly. Brush the top
edge of the pie with beaten egg, put on
the cover, press the edges, and pinch
them round with paste-pincers. Make a
hole in the middle of the lid, and ornament
the pie with leaves, which should
be stuck on with the white of an egg; then
brush it all over with the beaten yolk of
an egg, and bake the pie in an oven
with a soaking heat from 3 to 4 hours.
To ascertain when it is done, run a sharp-pointed
knife or skewer through the hole
at the top into the middle of the pie,
and if the meat feels tender, it is sufficiently
baked. Have ready about ½ pint
of very strong gravy, pour it through a
funnel into the hole at the top, stop up
the hole with a small leaf of baked
paste, and put the pie away until wanted
for use. Should it acquire too much
colour in the baking, cover it with white
paper, as the crust should not in the
least degree be burnt. Mushrooms,
truffles, and many other ingredients,
may be added to enrich the flavour of
these pies, and the very fleshy parts of
the meat may be larded. These pies are
more frequently served cold than hot,
and form excellent dishes for cold
suppers or breakfasts. The cover of the
pie is sometimes carefully removed,
leaving the perfect edges, and the top
decorated with square pieces of very
bright aspic jelly: this has an exceedingly
pretty effect. <i>Time.</i>—About 4
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for a very large pie. <i>Seasonable</i> from
March to October.</p>

<h3>RAISIN CHEESE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of raisins,
allow ½ lb. of loaf sugar; pounded
cinnamon and cloves to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Stone
the raisins; put them into a
stewpan with the sugar, cinnamon, and
cloves, and let them boil for 1½ hour,
stirring all the time. Let the preparation
cool a little, pour it into a glass
dish, and garnish with strips of candied
lemon-peel and citron. This will remain
good some time, if kept in a dry place.
<i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—1
lb. for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>RAISIN PUDDING, Boiled. (Plain
and Economical).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ½ lb. of
stoned raisins, ½ lb. of chopped suet, ½<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
saltspoonful of salt, milk. <i>Mode.</i>—After
having stoned the raisins and chopped
the suet finely, mix them with the flour,
add the salt, and when these dry ingredients
are thoroughly mixed, moisten
the pudding with sufficient milk to make
it into a rather stiff paste. Tie it up in
a floured cloth, put it into boiling water,
and boil for 4 hours: serve with sifted
sugar. This pudding may also be made
in a long shape, the same as a rolled jam-pudding,
and will not require quite so
long boiling;—2½ hours would then be
quite sufficient. <i>Time.</i>—Made round, 4
hours; in a long shape, 2½ hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 or 9 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in winter.</p>


<h3>RAISIN PUDDING, Baked. (Plain
and Economical.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ¾ lb. of
stoned raisins, ½ lb. of suet, a pinch of
salt, 1 oz. of sugar, a little grated nutmeg,
milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Chop the suet finely;
stone the raisins and cut them in halves;
mix these with the suet, add the salt,
sugar, and grated nutmeg, and moisten
the whole with sufficient milk to make it
of the consistency of thick batter. Put
the pudding into a pie-dish, and bake
for 1½ hour, or rather longer. Turn it
out of the dish, strew sifted sugar over,
and serve. This is a very plain recipe,
and suitable where there is a family of
children. It, of course, can be much
improved by the addition of candied peel,
currants, and rather a larger proportion
of suet: a few eggs would also make the
pudding richer. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in winter.</p>


<h3>RAMAKINS, to serve with the
Cheese Course.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of Cheshire cheese,
¼ lb. of Parmesan cheese, ¼ lb. of fresh
butter, 4 eggs, the crumb of a
small roll; pepper, salt, and pounded
mace to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the crumb
of the roll in milk for 5 minutes; strain,
and put it into a mortar; add the cheese,
which should be finely scraped, the
butter, the yolks of the eggs, and seasoning,
and pound these ingredients well
together. Whisk the whites of the eggs,
mix them with the paste, and put it into
small pans or saucers, which should not
be more than half filled. Bake them
from 10 to 12 minutes, and serve them
very hot and very quickly. This batter
answers equally well for macaroni after
it is boiled tender. <i>Time.</i>—10 or 12
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>RAMAKINS PASTRY, to serve
with the Cheese Course.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Any pieces of very good
light puff-paste, Cheshire, Parmesan, or
Stilton cheese. <i>Mode.</i>—The remains or
odd pieces of paste left from large tarts,
&amp;c., answer for making these little dishes.
Gather up the pieces of paste, roll it out
evenly, and sprinkle it with grated cheese
of a nice flavour. Fold the paste in three,
roll it out again, and sprinkle more cheese
over; fold the paste, roll it out, and with
a paste-cutter shape it in any way that
may be desired. Bake the ramakins in a
brisk oven from 10 to 15 minutes, dish
them on a hot napkin, and serve quickly.
The appearance of this dish may be very
much improved by brushing the ramakins
over with the yolk of egg before they are
placed in the oven. Where expense is not
objected to, Parmesan is the best kind
of cheese to use for making this dish.
<i>Time.</i>—10 to 15 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
with ½ lb. of paste, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6
or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY CREAM.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-283.jpg" width="300" height="199" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">RASPBERRY-CREAM MOULD.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ pint of milk, ¾ pint of
cream, 1½ oz. of isinglass, raspberry
jelly, sugar to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of
brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the milk, cream,
and isinglass together for ¼ hour, or
until the latter is melted, and strain it
through a hair sieve into a basin. Let it
cool a little; then add to it sufficient
raspberry jelly, which, when melted,
would make 1/3 pint, and stir well till the
ingredients are thoroughly mixed. If not
sufficiently sweet, add a little pounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
sugar with the brandy; whisk the mixture
well until nearly cold, put it into a
well-oiled mould, and set it in a cool
place till perfectly set. Raspberry jam
may be substituted for the jelly; but
must be melted, and rubbed through a
sieve, to free it from seeds: in summer,
the juice of the fresh fruit may be used,
by slightly mashing it with a wooden
spoon, and sprinkling sugar over it; the
juice that flows from the fruit should
then be used for mixing with the cream.
If the colour should not be very good, a
few drops of prepared cochineal may be
added to improve its appearance. <i>Time.</i>—¼
hour to boil the cream and isinglass.
<i>Average cost</i>, with cream at 1<i>s.</i> per pint,
and the best isinglass, 3<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to
fill a quart mould with fresh fruit in July.
<i>Seasonable</i>, with jelly, at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Strawberry cream may be made
in precisely the same manner, substituting
strawberry jam or jelly for the
raspberry.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of raspberries
allow 1 lb. of sugar, ¼ pint of red-currant
juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the fruit for
this preserve be gathered in fine weather,
and used as soon after it is picked as
possible. Take off the stalks, put the
raspberries into a preserving-pan, break
them well with a wooden spoon, and let
them boil for ¼ hour, keeping them well
stirred. Then add the currant-juice
and sugar, and boil again for ½ hour.
Skim the jam well after the sugar is
added, or the preserve will not be clear.
The addition of the currant-juice is a
very great improvement to this preserve,
as it gives it a piquant taste, which the
flavour of the raspberries seems to require.
<i>Time.</i>—¼ hour to simmer the
fruit without the sugar; ½ hour after it
is added. <i>Average cost</i>, from 6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i>
per lb. pot. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow about 1
pint of fruit to fill a 1 lb. pot. <i>Seasonable</i>
in July and August.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each pint of juice
allow ¾ lb. of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Let
the raspberries be freshly gathered, quite
ripe, and picked from the stalks; put
them into a large jar, after breaking the
fruit a little with a wooden spoon, and
place this jar, covered, in a saucepan of
boiling water. When the juice is well
drawn, which will be in from ¾ to 1 hour,
strain the fruit through a fine hair sieve
or cloth; measure the juice, and to every
pint allow the above proportion of loaf
sugar. Put the juice and sugar into a
preserving-pan, place it over the fire, and
boil gently until the jelly thickens when
a little is poured on a plate; carefully
remove all the scum as it rises, pour the
jelly into small pots, cover down, and
keep in a dry place. This jelly answers
for making raspberry cream, and for
flavouring various sweet dishes, when, in
winter, the fresh fruit is not obtainable.
<i>Time.</i>—¾ to 1 hour to draw the juice.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 9<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per lb. pot.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—From 3 pints to 2 quarts of
fruit should yield 1 pint of juice. <i>Seasonable.</i>—This
should be made in July or
August.</p>


<h3>RASPBERRY VINEGAR.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every 3 pints of the
best vinegar allow 4½ pints of freshly-gathered
raspberries; to each pint of
liquor allow 1 lb. of pounded loaf sugar,
1 wineglassful of brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Let
the raspberries be freshly gathered, pick
them from the stalks, and put 1½ pint of
them into a stone jar; pour 3 pints of
the best vinegar over them, and let them
remain for 24 hours; then strain the
liquor over another 1½ pint of fresh raspberries.
Let them remain another 24
hours, and the following day repeat the
process for the third time; then drain
off the liquor without pressing, and pass
it through a jelly-bag (previously wetted
with plain vinegar) into a stone jar. Add
to every pint of the liquor 1 lb. of
pounded loaf sugar; stir them together,
and, when the sugar is dissolved, cover
the jar, set it upon the fire in a saucepan
of boiling water, and let it boil for an
hour, removing the scum as fast as it
rises; add to each pint a glass of brandy,
bottle it, and seal the corks. This is an
excellent drink in cases of fevers and
colds: it should be diluted with cold
water, according to the taste or requirement
of the patient. <i>Time.</i>—To be
boiled 1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per
pint. <i>Sufficient</i> to make 2 quarts. <i>Seasonable.</i>—-Make
this in July or August,
when raspberries are most plentiful.</p>


<h3>RATAFIAS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of sweet almonds,
¼ lb. of bitter ones, ¾ lb. of sifted loaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
sugar, the white of 4 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Blanch,
skin, and dry the almonds, and
pound them in a mortar with the white
of an egg; stir in the sugar, and gradually
add the remaining whites of eggs,
taking care that they are very thoroughly
whisked. Drop the mixture, through a
small biscuit syringe, on to cartridge-paper,
and bake the cakes from 10 to 12
minutes in rather a quick oven. A
very small quantity should be dropped on
the paper to form one cake, as the mixture
spreads; when baked, the ratifias
should be about the size of a large button.
<i>Time.</i>—10 to 12 minutes.—<i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>


<h3>RAVIGOTTE, a French Salad Sauce
(Mons. Ude’s Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 teaspoonful of mushroom
ketchup, 1 teaspoonful of cavice, 1
teaspoonful of Chili vinegar, 1 teaspoonful
of Reading sauce, a piece of butter
the size of an egg, 3 tablespoonfuls of
thick Béchamel, 1 tablespoonful of
minced parsley, 3 tablespoonfuls of
cream; salt and pepper to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Scald
the parsley, mince the leaves
very fine, and add to it all the other ingredients;
after mixing the whole
together thoroughly, the sauce will be
ready for use. <i>Average cost</i>, for this
quantity, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>REMOULADE, or French Salad-Dressing.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, ½ tablespoonful
of made mustard, salt and cayenne to
taste, 3 tablespoonfuls of olive-oil, 1
tablespoonful of tarragon or plain vinegar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil 3 eggs quite hard for
about ¼ hour, put them into cold water,
and let them remain in it for a few
minutes; strip off the shells, put the
yolks in a mortar, and pound them very
smoothly; add to them, very gradually,
the mustard, seasoning, and vinegar,
keeping all well stirred and rubbed down
with the back of a wooden spoon. Put
in the oil drop by drop, and when this is
thoroughly mixed with the other ingredients,
add the yolk of a raw egg,
and stir well, when it will be ready for
use. This sauce should not be curdled;
and to prevent this, the only way is to
mix a little of everything at a time, and
not to cease stirring. The quantities of
oil and vinegar may be increased or
diminished according to taste, as many
persons would prefer a smaller proportion
of the former ingredient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green Remoulade</span> is made by using
tarragon vinegar instead of plain, and
colouring with a little parsley-juice.
Harvey’s sauce, or Chili vinegar, may
be added at pleasure. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour to
boil the eggs. <i>Average cost</i>, for this
quantity, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a salad made
for 4 or 6 persons.</p>


<h3>RHUBARB JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of rhubarb
allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar, the rind of ½
lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Wipe the rhubarb perfectly
dry, take off the string or peel,
and weigh it; put it into a preserving-pan,
with sugar in the above proportion;
mince the lemon-rind very finely, add it
to the other ingredients, and place the
preserving-pan by the side of the fire;
keep stirring to prevent the rhubarb
from burning, and when the sugar is
well dissolved, put the pan more over
the fire, and let the jam boil until it is
done, taking care to keep it well skimmed
and stirred with a wooden or silver spoon.
Pour it into pots, and cover down with
oiled and egged papers. <i>Time.</i>—If the
rhubarb is young and tender, ¾ hour,
reckoning from the time it simmers
equally; old rhubarb, 1¼ to 1½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> to 7<i>d.</i> per lb. pot.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—About 1 pint of sliced rhubarb
to fill a lb. pot. <i>Seasonable</i> from
February to May.</p>


<h3>RHUBARB AND ORANGE JAM,
to resemble Scotch Marmalade.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 quart of finely-cut rhubarb,
6 oranges, 1½ lb. of loaf sugar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Peel the oranges; remove as
much of the white pith as possible,
divide them, and take out the pips;
slice the pulp into a preserving-pan, add
the rind of half the oranges cut into thin
strips, and the loaf sugar, which should
be broken small. Peel the rhubarb, cut
it into thin pieces, put it to the oranges,
and stir altogether over a gentle fire
until the jam is done. Remove all the
scum as it rises, put the preserve into
pots, and, when cold, cover down.
Should the rhubarb be very old, stew
it alone for ¼ hour before the other
ingredients are added. <i>Time.</i>—¾ to 1
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, from 6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per
lb. pot. <i>Seasonable</i> from February to
May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>


<h3>RHUBARB PUDDING, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 or 5 sticks of fine rhubarb,
¼ lb. of moist sugar, ¾ lb. of suet-crust.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make a suet-crust with
¾ lb. of flour, and line a buttered basin
with it. Wash and wipe the rhubarb,
and, if old, string it—that is so say,
pare off the outside skin. Cut it into
inch lengths, fill the basin with it, put in
the sugar, and cover with crust. Pinch
the edges of the pudding together, tie
over it a floured cloth, put it into boiling
water, and boil from 2 to 2½ hours. Turn
it out of the basin, and serve with a jug
of cream and sifted sugar. <i>Time.</i>—2 to
2½ hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
February to May.</p>


<h3>RHUBARB TART.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of puff-paste, about
5 sticks of large rhubarb, ¼ lb. of moist
sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a puff-crust; line
the edges of a deep pie-dish with it, and
wash, wipe, and cut the rhubarb into
pieces about 1 inch long. Should it be
old and tough, string it—that is to say,
pare off the outside skin. Pile the fruit
high in the dish, as it shrinks very much
in the cooking; put in the sugar, cover
with crust, ornament the edges, and
bake the tart in a well-heated oven from
½ to ¾ hour. If wanted very nice, brush
it over with the white of an egg beaten
to a stiff froth, then sprinkle on it some
sifted sugar, and put it in the oven just
to set the glaze: this should be done
when the tart is nearly baked. A small
quantity of lemon-juice, and a little of
the peel minced, are by many persons
considered an improvement to the flavour
of rhubarb tart. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from February to May.</p>


<h3>RHUBARB WINE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every 5 lbs. of rhubarb
pulp allow 1 gallon of cold spring
water; to every gallon of liquor allow 3
lbs. of loaf sugar, ½ oz. of isinglass, the
rind of 1 lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Gather the
rhubarb about the middle of May; wipe
it with a wet cloth, and, with a mallet,
bruise it in a large wooden tub or other
convenient means. When reduced to a
pulp, weigh it, and to every 5 lbs. add 1
gallon of cold spring water; let these remain
for 3 days, stirring 3 or 4 times a
day; and on the fourth day, press the
pulp through a hair sieve; put the liquor
into a tub, and to every gallon put 3 lbs.
of loaf sugar; stir in the sugar until it is
quite dissolved, and add the lemon-rind;
let the liquor remain, and, in 4, 5, or 6
days, the fermentation will begin to subside,
and a crust or head will be formed,
which should be skimmed off, or the
liquor drawn from it, when the crust
begins to crack or separate. Put the
wine into a cask, and if, after that, it
ferments, rack it off into another cask,
and in a fortnight stop it down. If the
wine should have lost any of its original
sweetness, add a little more loaf sugar,
taking care that the cask is full. Bottle
it off in February or March, and in the
summer it should be fit to drink. It will
improve greatly by keeping; and, should
a very brilliant colour be desired, add a
little currant-juice. <i>Seasonable.</i> Make
this about the middle of May.</p>


<h3>RICE BISCUITS, or Cakes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every ½ lb. of rice-flour,
allow ¼ lb. of pounded lump sugar,
¼ lb. of butter, 2 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat
the butter to a cream, stir in the rice-flour
and pounded sugar, and moisten
the whole with the eggs, which should
be previously well beaten. Roll out the
paste, shape it with a round paste-cutter
into small cakes, and bake them from 12
to 18 minutes in a very slow oven. <i>Time.</i>—12
to 18 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> to make about 18 cakes. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE BLANCMANGE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of ground rice, 3 oz.
of loaf sugar, 1 oz. of fresh butter,
1 quart of milk, flavouring of lemon-peel,
essence of almonds or vanilla, or
laurel-leaves. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix the rice to a
smooth batter with about ½ pint of the
milk, and the remainder put into a saucepan,
with the sugar, butter, and whichever
of the above flavourings may be
preferred; bring the milk to the boiling-point,
quickly stir in the rice, and let it
boil for about 10 minutes, or until it
comes easily away from the saucepan,
keeping it well stirred the whole time.
Grease a mould with pure salad-oil;
pour in the rice, and let it get perfectly
set, when it should turn out quite easily;
garnish it with jam, or pour round a
compôte of any kind of fruit, just before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
it is sent to table. This blancmange is
better for being made the day before it
is wanted, as it then has time to become
firm. If laurel-leaves are used for flavouring,
steep 3 of them in the milk, and
take them out before the rice is added:
about 8 drops of essence of almonds, or
from 12 to 16 drops of essence of vanilla,
would be required to flavour the above
proportion of milk. <i>Time.</i>—From 10 to
15 minutes to boil the rice. <i>Average cost</i>,
9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill a quart mould.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE BREAD.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of rice allow
4 lbs. of wheat flour, nearly 3 tablespoonfuls
of yeast, ¼ oz. of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the rice in water until it is quite tender;
pour off the water, and put the rice, before
it is cold, to the flour. Mix these
well together with the yeast, salt, and
sufficient warm water to make the whole
into a smooth dough; let it rise by the
side of the fire, then form it into loaves,
and bake them from 1½ to 2 hours, according
to their size. If the rice is boiled
in milk instead of water, it makes very
delicious bread or cakes. When boiled
in this manner, it may be mixed with
the flour without straining the liquid
from it. <i>Time.</i>—1½ to 2 hours.</p>


<h3>RICE, Buttered.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of rice, 1½ pint of
milk, 2 oz. of butter, sugar to taste,
grated nutmeg or pounded cinnamon.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash and pick the rice, drain,
and put it into a saucepan with the milk;
let it swell gradually, and, when tender,
pour off the milk; stir in the butter,
sugar, and nutmeg or cinnamon, and,
when the butter is thoroughly melted,
and the whole is quite hot, serve. After
the milk is poured off, be particular that
the rice does not burn: to prevent this,
do not cease stirring it. <i>Time.</i>—About
¾ hour to swell the rice. <i>Average cost</i>,
7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE CAKE.</h3>

<div class="caption">CAKE-MOULD.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of ground rice, ½
lb. of flour, ½ lb. of loaf sugar, 9 eggs,
20 drops of essence of lemon, or the
rind of one lemon, ¼ lb. of butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Separate
the whites from the yolks of
the eggs; whisk them both well, and
add to the latter the butter beaten to a
cream. Stir in the flour,
rice, and lemon (if the
rind is used it must be
very finely minced), and
beat the mixture well;
then add the whites of
the eggs, beat the cake
again for some time, put
it into a buttered mould
or tin, and bake it for
nearly 1½ hour. It may
be flavoured with essence of almonds,
when this is preferred. <i>Time.</i>—Nearly
1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE, SAVOURY CASSEROLE
OF; or Rice Border, for Ragoûts,
Fricassées, &amp;c. (An
Entrée.)</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/illus-287b.jpg" width="215" height="75" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">CASSEROLE OF RICE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of rice, 3 pints of
weak stock or broth, 2 slices of fat ham,
1 teaspoonful of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—A casserole
of rice, when made in a mould, is
not such a difficult operation as when it
is moulded by the hand. It is an elegant
and inexpensive entrée, as the
remains of cold fish, flesh, or fowl, may
be served as
ragoûts, fricassées,
&amp;c.,
inclosed in the
casserole. It
requires great
nicety in its
preparation, the principal thing to attend
to being the boiling of the rice, as, if
this is not sufficiently cooked, the casserole,
when moulded, will have a rough
appearance, which would entirely spoil
it. After having washed the rice in two
or three waters, drain it well, and put it
into a stewpan with the stock, ham, and
salt; cover the pan closely, and let the
rice gradually swell over a slow fire, occasionally
stirring, to prevent its sticking.
When it is quite soft, strain it, pick out
the pieces of ham, and, with the back of
a large wooden spoon, mash the rice to a
perfectly smooth paste. Then well
grease a mould (moulds are made purposely
for rice borders), and turn it upside
down for a minute or two, to drain
away the fat, should there be too much;
put some rice all round the bottom
and sides of it; place a piece of soft
bread in the middle, and cover it with
rice; press it in equally with the spoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and let it cool. Then dip the mould into
hot water, turn the casserole carefully on
to a dish, mark where the lid is to be
formed on the top, by making an incision
with the point of a knife about an inch
from the edge all round, and put it into
a <i>very hot</i> oven. Brush it over with a
little clarified butter, and bake about ½
hour, or rather longer; then carefully
remove the lid, which will be formed by
the incision having been made all round,
and remove the bread, in small pieces,
with the point of a penknife, being careful
not to injure the casserole. Fill the
centre with the ragoût or fricassée,
which should be made thick; put on the
cover, glaze it, place it in the oven to set
the glaze, and serve as hot as possible.
The casserole should not be emptied too
much, as it is liable to crack from the
weight of whatever is put in; and, in
baking it, let the oven be very hot, or
the casserole will probably break. <i>Time.</i>—About
¾ hour to swell the rice. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 2 moderate-sized casseroles.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE, SWEET CASSEROLE OF
(an Entremets).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of rice, 3 pints of
milk, sugar to taste, flavouring of bitter
almonds, 3 oz. of butter, the yolks of 3
eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—This is made in precisely
the same manner as a savoury casserole,
only substituting the milk and sugar for
the stock and salt. Put the milk into a
stewpan, with sufficient essence of bitter
almonds to flavour it well; then add the
rice, which should be washed, picked,
and drained, and let it swell gradually
in the milk over a slow fire. When it is
tender, stir in the sugar, butter, and
yolks of eggs; butter a mould, press in
the rice, and proceed in exactly the same
manner as in preceding recipe. When
the casserole is ready, fill it with a compôte
of any fruit that may be preferred,
or with melted apricot-jam, and serve.
<i>Time.</i>—From ¾ to 1 hour to swell the
rice, ½ to ¾ hour to bake the casserole.
<i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the compôte or
jam, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 2 casseroles.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE CROQUETTES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of rice, 1 quart of
milk, 6 oz. of pounded sugar, flavouring
of vanilla, lemon-peel, or bitter almonds,
egg and bread-crumbs, hot lard. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the rice, milk, and sugar into
a saucepan, and let the former gradually
swell over a gentle fire until all the milk
is dried up; and just before the rice is
done, stir in a few drops of essence of
any of the above flavourings. Let the
rice get cold; then form it into small
round balls, dip them into yolk of egg,
sprinkle them with bread-crumbs, and
fry them in boiling lard for about 10
minutes, turning them about, that they
may get equally browned. Drain the
greasy moisture from them, by placing
them on a cloth in front of the fire for a
minute or two; pile them on a white
d’oyley, and send them quickly to table.
A small piece of jam is sometimes introduced
into the middle of each croquette,
which adds very much to the flavour of
this favourite dish. <i>Time.</i>—From ¾ to 1
hour to swell the rice; about 10 minutes
to fry the croquettes. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> to make 7 or 8 croquettes.

<h3>RICE FRITTERS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of
milk, 3 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of fresh butter,
6 oz. of orange marmalade, 4 eggs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Swell the rice in the milk, with
the sugar and butter, over a slow fire
until it is perfectly tender, which will be
in about ¾ hour. When the rice is done,
strain away the milk, should there be
any left, and mix with it the marmalade
and well-beaten eggs; stir the whole
over the fire until the eggs are set; then
spread the mixture on a dish to the
thickness of about ½ inch, or rather
thicker. When it is perfectly cold, cut
it into long strips, dip them in a batter
the same as for apple fritters, and fry
them a nice brown. Dish them on a
white d’oyley, strew sifted sugar over,
and serve quickly. <i>Time.</i>—About ¾ hour
to swell the rice; from 7 to 10 minutes
to fry the fritters. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>

at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE-MILK.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 tablespoonfuls of rice,
1 quart of milk, sugar to taste; when

time to time to prevent the milk from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
burning; sweeten it, add a little grated
nutmeg, and serve. This dish is also
very suitable and wholesome for children;
it may be flavoured with a little
lemon-peel, and a little finely-minced
suet may be boiled with it, which renders
it more strengthening and more wholesome.
Tapioca, semolina, vermicelli,
and macaroni, may all be dressed in the
same manner. <i>Time.</i>—From ¾ to 1 hour.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

over the top, and bake the pudding, in a
<i>moderate</i> oven, from 1½ to 2 hours. As
the rice is not previously cooked, care

made with apples; they should be pared,
cored, and cut into thin slices.</p>


<h3>RICE PUDDING, French, or Gâteau
de Riz.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every ¼ lb. of rice
allow 1 quart of milk, the rind of 1
lemon, ½ teaspoonful of salt, sugar to
taste, 4 oz. of butter, 6 eggs, bread-crumbs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk into a
stewpan with the lemon-rind, and let it
infuse for ½ hour, or until the former is
well flavoured; then take out the peel,
have ready the rice washed, picked, and
drained; put it into the milk, and let it
gradually swell over a very slow fire.
Stir in the butter, salt, and sugar, and,
when properly sweetened, add the yolks
of the eggs, and then the whites, both of
which should be well beaten, and added
separately to the rice. Butter a mould,
strew in some fine bread-crumbs, and let
them be spread equally over it; then
carefully pour in the rice, and bake the
pudding in a <i>slow</i> oven for 1 hour. Turn
it out of the mould, and garnish the dish
with preserved cherries, or any bright-coloured
jelly or jam. This pudding
would be exceedingly nice flavoured with
essence of vanilla. <i>Time.</i>—¾ to 1 hour
for the rice to swell; to be baked 1 hour
in a slow oven. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE PUDDING, Baked or Boiled
Ground.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 pints of milk, 6 tablespoonfuls
of ground rice, sugar to taste,
4 eggs, flavouring of lemon-rind, nutmeg,
bitter-almonds or bay-leaf. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
1½ pint of the milk into a stewpan
with any of the above flavourings, and
bring it to the boiling point, and, with
the other ½ pint of milk, mix the ground
rice to a smooth batter; strain the boiling
milk to this, and stir over the fire
until the mixture is tolerably thick;
then pour it into a basin, leave it uncovered,
and when nearly or quite cold
sweeten it to taste, and add the eggs,
which should be previously well beaten,
with a little salt. Put the pudding into
a well-buttered basin, tie it down with a
cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and
boil for 1½ hour. For a baked pudding,
proceed in precisely the same manner,
only using half the above proportion of
ground rice, with the same quantity of
all the other ingredients: an hour will
bake the pudding in a moderate oven.
Stewed fruit, or preserves, or marmalade,
may be served with either the boiled or
baked pudding, and will be found an
improvement. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour to boil,
1 hour to bake. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE PUDDING, Iced.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of
milk, ½ lb. of sugar, the yolks of 6 eggs,
1 small teaspoonful of essence of vanilla.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the rice into a stewpan, with
the milk and sugar, and let these simmer
over a gentle fire until the rice is sufficiently
soft to break up into a smooth
mass, and should the milk dry away too
much, a little more may be added. Stir
the rice occasionally, to prevent its burning,
then beat it to a smooth mixture;
add the yolks of the eggs, which should
be well whisked, and the vanilla (should
this flavouring not be liked, essence of
bitter almonds may be substituted for
it); put this rice custard into the freezing-pot,
and proceed as directed in the
recipe for <a href="#ICED-PUDDING">Iced Pudding</a>. When wanted
for table, turn the pudding out of the
mould, and pour over the top and round
it a compôte of oranges, or any other
fruit that may be preferred, taking care
that the flavouring in the pudding harmonizes
well with the fruit that is
served with it. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour to freeze
the mixture. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; exclusive
of the compôte, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable.</i>—Served
all the year round.</p>


<h3>RICE PUDDINGS, Miniature.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of rice, 1½ pint of
milk, 2 oz. of fresh butter, 4 eggs, sugar
to taste, flavouring of lemon-peel, bitter
almonds, or vanilla; a few strips of candied
peel. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the rice swell
in 1 pint of the milk over a slow fire,
putting with it a strip of lemon-peel;
stir to it the butter and the other ½ pint
of milk, and let the mixture cool. Then
add the well-beaten eggs, and a few drops
of essence of almonds or essence of vanilla,
whichever may be preferred; butter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
well some small cups or moulds, line
them with a few pieces of candied peel
sliced very thin, fill them three parts
full, and bake for about 40 minutes; turn
them out of the cups on to a white d’oyley,
and serve with sweet sauce. The
flavouring and candied peel might be
omitted, and stewed fruit or preserve
served instead, with these puddings.
<i>Time.</i>—40 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 6 puddings. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>RICE SNOWBALLS (A Pretty
Dish for Juvenile Suppers).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of
milk, flavouring of essence of almonds,
sugar to taste, 1 pint of custard. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the rice in the milk, with sugar
and a flavouring of essence of almonds,
until the former is tender, adding, if necessary,
a little more milk, should it dry
away too much. When the rice is quite
soft, put it into teacups, or <i>small</i> round
jars, and let it remain until cold; then
turn the rice out on a deep glass dish,
pour over a custard, and on the top of
each ball place a small piece of bright-coloured
preserve or jelly. Lemon-peel
or vanilla may be boiled with the rice
instead of the essence of almonds, when
either of these is preferred; but the
flavouring of the custard must correspond
with that of the rice. <i>Time.</i>—About
¾ hour to swell the rice in the
milk. <i>Average cost</i>, with the custard,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 children.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE SOUFFLÉ.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 tablespoonfuls of
ground rice, 1 pint of milk, 5 eggs,
pounded sugar to taste, flavouring of
lemon-rind, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, or
anything that may be preferred, a piece
of butter the size of a walnut. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix
the ground rice with 6 tablespoonfuls
of the milk quite smoothly, and put
it into a saucepan with the remainder of
the milk and butter, and keep stirring it
over the fire for about ¼ hour, or until
the mixture thickens. Separate the
yolks from the whites of the eggs, beat
the former in a basin, and stir to them
the rice and sufficient pounded sugar to
sweeten the soufflé; but add this latter
ingredient as sparingly as possible, as
the less sugar there is used the lighter
will be the soufflé. Mow whisk the
whites of the eggs to a stiff froth or
snow; mix them with the other preparation,
and pour the whole into a soufflé-dish,
and put it instantly into the oven;
bake it about ½ hour in a moderate oven,
take it out, hold a salamander or hot
shovel over the top, sprinkle sifted sugar
over it, and send the soufflé to table in
the dish it was baked in, either with a
napkin pinned round, or inclosed in a
more ornamental dish. The excellence
of this fashionable dish entirely depends
on the proper whisking of the whites of
the eggs, the manner of baking, and the
expedition with which it is sent to table.
Soufflés should be served <i>instantly</i> from
the oven, or they will sink, and be
nothing more than an ordinary pudding.
<i>Time.</i>—About ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 oz. of Patna rice, salt,
cayenne, and mace, 2 quarts of white
stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Throw the rice into
boiling water, and let it boil until
tender; then pour it into a sieve, and
allow it to drain well. Now add it to the
stock boiling, and allow it to simmer a
few minutes; season to taste. Serve
quickly. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>


<h3>RICE SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of rice, the yolks
of 4 eggs, ½ a pint of cream, rather
more than two quarts of stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the rice in the stock, and rub
half of it through a tammy; put the
stock in the stewpan, add all the rice,
and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Beat
the yolks of the eggs, mix them with the
cream (previously boiled), and strain
through a hair sieve; take the soup off
the fire, add the eggs and cream, stirring
frequently. Heat it gradually, stirring
all the time; but do not let it boil, or
the eggs will curdle. <i>Time.</i>—2 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the
year.</p>


<h3>RICE for Curries, &amp;c., Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ lb. of rice, water, salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—Pick, wash, and soak the rice in
plenty of cold water; then have ready a
saucepan of boiling water, drop the rice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
into it, and keep it boiling quickly, with
the lid uncovered, until it is tender, but
not soft. Take it up, drain it, and put
it on a dish before the fire to dry; do
not handle it much with a spoon, but
shake it about a little with two forks,
that it may all be equally dried, and
strew over it a little salt. It is now
ready to serve, and may be heaped
lightly on a dish by itself, or be laid
round the dish as a border, with a curry
or fricassee in the centre. Some cooks
smooth the rice with the back of a
spoon, and then brush it over with the
yolk of an egg, and set it in the oven to
colour; but the rice, well boiled, white,
dry, and with every grain distinct, is by
far the more preferable mode of dressing
it. During the process of boiling, the
rice should be attentively watched, that
it be not overdone, as, if this is the case,
it will have a mashed and soft appearance.
<i>Time.</i>—15 to 25 minutes, according
to the quality of the rice. <i>Average
cost</i>, 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a large dish of
curry. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>RICE, To Boil, for Curries, &amp;c.
(Soyer’s Recipe.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of the best Carolina
rice, 2 quarts of water, 1½ oz. of
butter, a little salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the
rice well in two waters; make 2 quarts
of water boiling, and throw the rice into
it; boil it until three-parts done, then
drain it on a sieve. Butter the bottom
and sides of a stewpan, put in the rice,
place the lid on tightly, and set it by the
side of the fire, until the rice is perfectly
tender, occasionally shaking the pan to
prevent its sticking. Prepared thus,
every grain should be separate and white.
Either dish it separately, or place it
round the curry as a border. <i>Time.</i>—15
to 25 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 2 moderate-sized curries. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>ROASTING, Memoranda in.</h3>

<p>The management of the fire is a point
of primary importance in roasting. A
radiant fire throughout the operation is
absolutely necessary to insure a good
result. When the article to be dressed
is thin and delicate, the fire may be
small; but when the joint is large the
fire must fill the grate. Meat must never
be put down before a hollow or exhausted
fire, which may soon want recruiting;
on the other hand, if the heat of the fire
become too fierce, the meat must be
removed to a considerable distance till
it has somewhat abated. Some cooks
always fail in roasting, though they succeed
in nearly everything else. A
French writer on the culinary art says
that anybody can learn how to cook,
but one must be born a roaster. According
to Liebig, beef or mutton cannot
be said to be sufficiently roasted, until
it has acquired throughout the whole
mass a temperature of 158°. But poultry
may be well cooked when the inner parts
have attained a temperature of 130° to
140°. This depends on the greater
amount of blood which beef and mutton
contain, the colouring matter of blood
not being coagulable under 158°.</p>


<h3>ROLLS, Excellent.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour
allow 1 oz. of butter, ¼ pint of milk,
a large teaspoonful of yeast, a little salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—Warm the butter in the milk,
add to it the yeast and salt, and mix
these ingredients well together. Put the
flour into a pan, stir in the above ingredients,
and let the dough rise, covered
in a warm place. Knead it well, make
it into rolls, let them rise again for a few
minutes, and bake in a quick oven.
Richer rolls may be made by adding 1
or 2 eggs and a larger proportion of
butter, and their appearance improved
by brushing the tops over with yolk of
egg or a little milk. <i>Time.</i>—1 lb. of
flour, divided into 6 rolls, from 15 to 20
minutes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/illus-292.jpg" width="292" height="87" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">ROLLS.</div>
</div>


<h3>ROLLS, Hot.</h3>

<p>This dish, although very unwholesome
and indigestible, is nevertheless a
great favourite, and eaten by many
persons. As soon as the rolls come from
the baker’s, they should be put into the
oven, which, in the early part of the
morning, is sure not to be very hot; and
the rolls must not be buttered until
wanted. When they are quite hot,
divide them lengthwise into three; put
some thin flakes of good butter between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the slices, press the rolls together, and
put them in the oven for a minute or
two, but not longer, or the butter would
oil; take them out of the oven, spread
the butter equally over, divide the rolls
in half, and put them on to a very hot
clean dish, and send them instantly to
table.</p>


<h3>ROLLS, Fluted.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Puff-paste, the white of
an egg, sifted sugar, jelly or preserve.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make some good puff-paste
(trimmings answer very well for little
dishes of this sort); roll it out to the
thickness of ¼ inch, and with a round fluted
paste-cutter stamp out as many round
pieces as may be required; brush over
the upper side with the white of an egg;
roll up the pieces, pressing the paste
lightly together where it joins; place
the rolls on a baking-sheet, and bake
for about ¼ hour. A few minutes before
they are done, brush them over with the
white of an egg; strew over sifted sugar,
put them back in the oven; and when
the icing is firm and of a pale brown
colour, they are done. Place a strip of
jelly or preserve across each roll, dish
them high on a napkin, and serve cold.
<i>Time.</i>—¼ hour before being iced; 5 to
10 minutes after. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient.</i>—½ lb. of puff-paste for 2
dishes. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>ROUX, Brown, a French Thickening
for Gravies and Sauces.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of butter, 9 oz. of
flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Melt the butter in a stewpan
over a slow fire, and dredge in, very
gradually, the flour; stir it till of a light-brown
colour—to obtain this do it very
slowly, otherwise the flour will burn and
impart a bitter taste to the sauce it is
mixed with. Pour it in a jar, and keep
it for use: it will remain good some time.
<i>Time.</i>—About ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>ROUX, White, for thickening
White Sauces.</h3>

<p>Allow the same proportions of butter
and flour as in the preceding recipe,
and proceed in the same manner as for
brown roux, but do not keep it on the
fire too long, and take care not to let it
colour. This is used for thickening white
sauce. Pour it into a jar to use when
wanted. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient.</i>—A dessertspoonful will thicken
a pint of gravy.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Besides the above, sauces may
be thickened with potato flour, ground
rice, baked flour, arrowroot, &amp;c.: the
latter will be found far preferable to the
ordinary flour for white sauces. A slice
of bread, toasted and added to gravies,
answers the two purposes of thickening
and colouring them.</p>


<h3>RUMP-STEAK, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Steaks, butter or clarified
dripping. <i>Mode.</i>—Although broiling is
a far superior method of cooking steaks
to frying them, yet, when the cook is not
very expert, the latter mode may be
adopted; and, when properly done, the
dish may really look very inviting, and
the flavour be good. The steaks should
be cut rather thinner than for broiling,
and with a small quantity of fat to each.
Put some butter or clarified dripping
into a frying-pan; let it get quite hot,
then lay in the steaks. Turn them frequently
until done, which will be in
about 8 minutes, or rather more, should
the steaks be very thick. Serve on a
very hot dish, in which put a small piece
of butter and a tablespoonful of ketchup,
and season with pepper and salt. They
should be sent to table quickly, as when
cold the steaks are entirely spoiled.
<i>Time.</i>—8 minutes for a medium-sized
steak, rather longer for a very thick one.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> all
the year, but not good in summer, as the
meat cannot hang to get tender.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Where much gravy is liked,
make it in the following manner:—As
soon as the steaks are done, dish them,
pour a little boiling water into the frying-pan,
add a seasoning of pepper and salt,
a small piece of butter, and a tablespoonful
of Harvey’s sauce or mushroom ketchup.
Hold the pan over the fire for a
minute or two, just let the gravy simmer,
then pour on the steak, and serve.</p>

some tender rump-steak (that which
has been hung a little time), and divide
it into pieces about an inch square, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
cut each kidney into 8 pieces. Line the
dish with crust made with suet and flour
in the above proportion, leaving a small
piece of crust to overlap the edge. Then
cover the bottom with a portion of the
steak and a few pieces of kidney; season
with salt and pepper (some add a little
flour to thicken the gravy, but it is not
necessary), and then add another layer
of steak, kidney, and seasoning. Proceed
in this manner till the dish is full, when
pour in sufficient water to come within
2 inches of the top of the basin. Moisten
the edges of the crust, cover the pudding
over, press the two crusts together, that
the gravy may not escape, and turn up
the overhanging paste. Wring out a
cloth in hot water, flour it, and tie up
the pudding; put it into boiling water,
and let it boil for at least 4 hours. If
the water diminishes, always replenish
with some hot in a jug, as the pudding
should be kept covered all the time, and
not allowed to stop boiling. When the
cloth is removed, cut out a round piece
in the top of the crust, to prevent the
pudding bursting, and send it to table in
the basin, either in an ornamental dish,
or with a napkin pinned round it. Serve
quickly. <i>Time.</i>—For a pudding with
2 lbs. of steak and 2 kidneys allow 4
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year,
but more suitable in winter.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Rump-steak pudding may be
very much enriched by adding a few
oysters or mushrooms. In Sussex, the
inhabitants are noted for their savoury
puddings, which are usually made in the
manner just described. It differs from
the general way of making them, as the
meat is cut up into very small pieces
and the basin is differently shaped, resembling
a very large saucer: on trial,
this pudding will be found far nicer, and
more full of gravy, than when laid in
large pieces in the dish.</p>


<h3>RUMP-STEAK AND OYSTER
SAUCE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 dozen oysters, ingredients
for oyster sauce, 2 lb. of rump-steak,
seasoning to taste of pepper and
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Make the oyster sauce,
and when that is ready, put it by
the side of the fire, but do not let
it keep boiling. Have the steaks cut
of an equal thickness, broil them over a
very clear fire, turning them often, that
the gravy may not escape. In about 8
minutes they will be done, when put
them on a very hot dish; smother with
the oyster sauce, and the remainder send
to table in a tureen. Serve quickly.
<i>Time.</i>—About 8 to 10 minutes, according
to the thickness of the steak. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from September to April.</p>


<h3>RUMP-STEAK or BEEF-STEAK,
Broiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Steaks, a piece of butter
the size of a walnut, salt to taste, 1
tablespoonful of good mushroom ketchup
or Harvey’s sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—As
the success of a good broil so much
depends on the state of the fire, see that
it is bright and clear, and perfectly free
from smoke, and do not add any fresh
fuel just before you require to use the
gridiron. Sprinkle a little salt over the
fire, put on the gridiron for a few minutes,
to get thoroughly hot through;
rub it with a piece of fresh suet, to prevent
the meat from sticking, and lay on
the steaks, which should be cut of an
equal thickness, about ¾ of an inch, or
rather thinner, and level them by beating
them as <i>little</i> as possible with a rolling
pin. Turn them frequently with steak-tongs
(if these are not at hand, stick a
fork in the edge of the fat, that no gravy
escapes), and in from 8 to 10 minutes
they will be done. Have ready a very
hot dish, into which put the ketchup,
and, when liked, a little minced shalot;
dish up the steaks, rub them over with
butter, and season with pepper and salt.
The exact time for broiling steaks must
be determined by taste, whether they
are liked underdone or well done; more
than 10 minutes for a steak
¾ inch in thickness, we think, would
spoil and dry up the juices of the meat.
Great expedition is necessary in sending
broiled steaks to table; and, to have
them in perfection, they should not be
cooked till everything else prepared for
dinner has been dished up, as their excellence
entirely depends on their being
served very hot. Garnish with scraped
horseradish, or slices of cucumber.
Oyster, tomato, onion, and many other
sauces, are frequent accompaniments to
rump-steak, but true lovers of this
English dish generally reject all additions
but pepper and salt. <i>Time.</i>—8 to 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per lb.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow ½ lb. to each person;
if the party consist entirely of gentlemen,
¾ lb. will not be too much. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year, but not good in the
height of summer, as the meat cannot
hang long enough to be tender.</p>


<h3>RUMP-STEAK PIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 lbs. of rump-steak,
seasoning to taste of salt, cayenne, and
black pepper, crust, water, the yolk of
an egg. <i>Mode.</i>—Have the steaks cut
from a rump that has hung a few days,
that they may be tender, and be particular
that every portion is perfectly
sweet. Cut the steaks into pieces about
3 inches long and 2 wide, allowing a
<i>small</i> piece of fat to each piece of lean,
and arrange the meat in layers in a pie-dish.
Between each layer sprinkle a
seasoning of salt, pepper, and, when
liked, a few grains of cayenne. Fill the
dish sufficiently with meat to support
the crust, and to give it a nice raised
appearance when baked, and not to
look flat and hollow. Pour in sufficient
water to half fill the dish, and
border it with paste (<i>see</i> <a href="#PASTE_Common">Pastry</a>); brush
it over with a little water, and put
on the cover; slightly press down the
edges with the thumb, and trim off close
to the dish. Ornament the pie with
leaves, or pieces of paste cut in any shape
that fancy may direct, brush it over
with the beaten yolk of an egg; make a
hole in the top of the crust, and bake in
a hot oven for about 1½ hour. <i>Time.</i>—In
a hot oven, 1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
for this size, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 6 or
8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>RUMP-STEAK PUDDING,
Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of flour, 2 eggs, not
quite 1 pint of milk, salt to taste, 1½ lb.
of rump-steaks, 1 kidney, pepper and
salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the steaks into nice
square pieces, with a small quantity of
fat, and the kidney divide into small
pieces. Make a batter of flour, eggs,
and milk in the above proportion; lay
a little of it at the bottom of a pie-dish;
then put in the steaks and kidney, which
should be well seasoned with pepper and
salt, and pour over the remainder of the
batter, and bake for 1½ hour in a brisk
but not fierce oven. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>RUMP-STEAK, Rolled, Roasted,
and Stuffed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of rump-steak,
forcemeat, pepper and salt to taste,
clarified butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Have the steaks
cut rather thick from a well-hung
rump of beef, and sprinkle over them a
seasoning of pepper and salt. Make
a forcemeat; spread it over <i>half</i> of
the steak; roll it up, bind and
skewer it firmly, that the forcemeat
may not escape, and roast it before a
nice clear fire for about 1½ hour, or rather
longer, should the roll be very large
and thick. Keep it constantly basted
with butter, and serve with brown
gravy, some of which must be poured
round the steak, and the remainder
sent to table in a tureen. <i>Time.</i>—1½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year,
but best in winter.</p>


<h3>RUMP-STEAK WITH FRIED
POTATOES, or BIFTEK AUX
POMMES-DE-TERRE (à la
Mode Française).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lb. of steak, 8 potatoes,
¼ lb. of butter, salt and pepper to
taste, 1 teaspoonful of minced herbs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the butter into a frying or
sauté pan, set it over the fire, and let it
get very hot; peel, and cut the potatoes
into long thin slices; put them into the
hot butter, and fry them till of a nice
brown colour. Now broil the steaks over
a bright clear fire, turning them frequently,
that every part may be equally
done: as they should not be thick,
5 minutes will broil them. Put the herbs
and seasoning in the butter the potatoes
were fried in, pour it under the steak,
and place the fried potatoes round, as a
garnish. To have this dish in perfection,
a portion of the fillet of the sirloin should
be used, as the meat is generally so much
more tender than that of the rump, and
the steaks should be cut about 1/3 of an
inch in thickness. <i>Time.</i>—5 minutes to
broil the steaks, and about the same time
to fry the potatoes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i>
per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year; but not so good in
warm weather, as the meat cannot hang
to get tender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>


<h3>RUMP- or BEEF-STEAK, Stewed
(an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—About 2 lbs. of beef or
rump steak, 3 onions, 2 turnips, 3 carrots,
2 or 3 oz. of butter, ½ pint of water,
1 teaspoonful of salt, ½ do. of pepper,
1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1 tablespoonful
of flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Have the steaks
cut tolerably thick and rather lean;
divide them into convenient-sized pieces,
and fry them in the butter a nice brown
on both sides. Cleanse and pare the
vegetables, cut the onions and carrots
into thin slices, and the turnips into
dice, and fry these in the same fat that
the steaks were done in. Put all into a
saucepan, add ½ pint of water, or rather
more should it be necessary, and simmer
very gently for 2½ or 3 hours; when
nearly done, skim well, add salt, pepper,
and ketchup in the above proportions,
and thicken with a tablespoonful of
flour mixed with 2 of cold water. Let it
boil up for a minute or two after the
thickening is added, and serve. When
a vegetable-scoop is at hand, use it to
cut the vegetables in fanciful shapes;
and tomato, Harvey’s sauce, or walnut-liquor
may be used to flavour the gravy.
It is less rich if stewed the previous day,
so that the fat may be taken off when
cold; when wanted for table, it will
merely require warming through.
<i>Time.</i>—3 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> per lb.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>RUSKS, to make (Suffolk Recipe).</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 198px;">
<img src="images/illus-296.jpg" width="198" height="59" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">RUSKS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of flour
allow 2 oz. of butter, ¼ pint of milk,
2 oz. of loaf sugar, 3 eggs, 1 tablespoonful
of yeast. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk and
butter into a saucepan, and keep shaking
it round until the latter is melted. Put
the flour into a basin with the sugar,
mix these well
together,  and
beat the eggs.
Stir them with
the yeast to the
milk and butter,
and with this liquid work the flour into
a smooth dough. Cover a cloth over the
basin, and leave the dough to rise by the
side of the fire; then knead it, and divide
it into 12 pieces; place them in a
brisk oven, and bake for about 20 minutes.
Take the rusks out, break them
in half, and then set them in the oven
to get crisp on the other side. When
cold, they should be put into tin canisters
to keep them dry; and if intended
for the cheese course, the sifted
sugar should be omitted. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes
to bake the rusks; 5 minutes to
render them crisp after being divided.
<i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to make 2
dozen rusks. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>RUSKS, Italian.</h3>

<p>A stale Savoy or lemon cake may be
converted into very good rusks in the
following manner. Cut the cake into
slices, divide each slice in two; put them
on a baking-sheet, in a slow oven, and
when they are of a nice brown and quite
hard, they are done. They should be
kept in a closed tin canister in a dry
place, to preserve their crispness.</p>


<h3>SAGE-AND-ONION STUFFING,
for Geese, Ducks, and Pork.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 large onions, 10 sage-leaves,
¼ lb. of bread-crumbs, 1½ oz. of
butter, salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg.
<i>Mode.</i>—Peel the onions, put them into
boiling water, let them simmer for 5 minutes
or rather longer, and just before
they are taken out, put in the sage-leaves
for a minute or two to take off
their rawness. Chop both these very
fine, add the bread, seasoning, and
butter, and work the whole together
with the yolk of an egg, when the stuffing
will be ready for use. It should be
rather highly seasoned, and the sage-leaves
should be very finely chopped.
Many cooks do not parboil the onions in
the manner just stated, but merely use
them raw. The stuffing then, however,
is not nearly so mild, and, to many
tastes, its strong flavour would be very
objectionable. When made for goose,
a portion of the liver of the bird, simmered
for a few minutes and very finely
minced, is frequently added to this stuffing;
and where economy is studied, the
egg may be dispensed with. <i>Time.</i>—Rather
more than 5 minutes to simmer
the onions. <i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity,
4<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 goose, or a pair
of ducks.</p>


<h3>SAGO PUDDING.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ pint of milk, 3 tablespoonfuls
of sago, the rind of ½ lemon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
3 oz. of sugar, 4 eggs, 1½ oz. of butter,
grated nutmeg, puff-paste. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the milk and lemon-rind into a stewpan,
place it by the side of the fire, and
let it remain until the milk is well flavoured
with the lemon; then strain it,
mix with it the sago and sugar, and
simmer gently for about 15 minutes. Let
the mixture cool a little, and stir to it
the eggs, which should be well beaten,
and the butter. Line the edges of a pie-dish
with puff-paste, pour in the pudding,
grate a little nutmeg over the top,
and bake from ¾ to 1 hour. <i>Time.</i>—¾ to
1 hour, or longer if the oven is very slow.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The above pudding may be
boiled instead of baked; but then allow
2 extra tablespoonfuls of sago, and boil
the pudding in a buttered basin from 1¼
to 1¾ hour.</p>


<h3>SAGO SAUCE FOR SWEET
PUDDINGS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 tablespoonful of sago,
1/3 pint of water, ¼ pint of port or sherry,
the rind and juice of 1 small lemon,
sugar to taste; when the flavour is liked,
a little pounded cinnamon. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
the sago in two or three waters;
then put it into a saucepan, with the
water and lemon-peel; let it simmer gently
by the side of the fire for 10 minutes, then
take out the lemon-peel, add the remaining
ingredients, give one boil, and serve.
Be particular to strain the lemon-juice
before adding it to the sauce. This, on
trial, will be found a delicious accompaniment
to various boiled puddings,
such as those made of bread, raisins,
rice, &amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8 persons.</p>


<h3>SAGO SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—5 oz. of sago, 2 quarts
of stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash the sago in
boiling water, add it, by degrees, to
the boiling stock, and simmer till the
sago is entirely dissolved, and forms a
sort of jelly. <i>Time.</i>—Nearly an hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> all the year.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The yolks of 2 eggs, beaten up
with a little cream, previously boiled, and
added at the moment of serving, much
improves this soup.</p>


<h3>SALAD, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 heads of celery, 1 pint
of French beans, lettuce, and endive.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil the celery and beans separately
until tender, and cut the celery
into pieces about 2 inches long. Put
these into a salad-bowl or dish; pour over
either of the salad dressings, and garnish
the dish with a little lettuce finely
chopped, blanched endive, or a few tufts
of boiled cauliflower. This composition,
if less agreeable than vegetables in their
raw state, is more wholesome; for salads,
however they may be compounded, when
eaten uncooked, prove to some people
indigestible. Tarragon, chervil, burnet,
and boiled onion, may be added to the
above salad with advantage, as also
slices of cold meat, poultry, or fish.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—From July to October.</p>


<h3>SALAD DRESSING (Excellent).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 teaspoonful of mixed
mustard, 1 teaspoonful of pounded
sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 4 tablespoonfuls
of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of
vinegar, cayenne and salt to taste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the mixed mustard into a
salad-bowl with the sugar, and add the
oil drop by drop, carefully stirring and
mixing all these ingredients well together.
Proceed in this manner with the
milk and vinegar, which must be added
very <i>gradually</i>, or the sauce will curdle.
Put in the seasoning, when the mixture
will be ready for use. If this dressing
is properly made, it will have a soft
creamy appearance, and will be found
very delicious with crab, or cold fried
fish (the latter cut into dice), as well as
with salads. In mixing salad dressings,
the ingredients cannot be added <i>too
gradually</i>, or <i>stirred too much</i>. <i>Average
cost</i>, for this quantity, 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
a small salad.</p>

<p>This recipe can be confidently recommended
by the editress, to whom it was
given by an intimate friend noted for
her salads.</p>


<h3>SALAD DRESSING (Excellent).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of
mixed mustard, ¼ teaspoonful of white
pepper, half that quantity of cayenne,
salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream,
vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the eggs until
hard, which will be in about ¼ hour or
20 minutes; put them into cold water,
take off the shells, and pound the yolks
in a mortar to a smooth paste. Then
add all the other ingredients, except
the vinegar, and stir them well until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the whole are thoroughly incorporated
one with the other. Pour in sufficient
vinegar to make it of the consistency
of cream, taking care to add but little
at a time. The mixture will then be
ready for use. <i>Average cost</i>, for this
quantity, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a moderate-sized
salad.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The whites of the eggs, cut
into rings, will serve very well as a
garnishing to the salad.</p>


<h3>SALAD DRESSING (Excellent).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 egg, 1 teaspoonful of
salad oil, 1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard,
¼ teaspoonful of salt, ½ teaspoonful of
pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar,
6 tablespoonfuls of cream. <i>Mode.</i>—Prepare
and mix the ingredients by the
preceding recipe, and be very particular
that the whole is well stirred.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—In making salads, the vegetables,
&amp;c., should never be added to the
sauce very long before they are wanted
for table; the dressing, however, may
always be prepared some hours before
required. Where salads are much in
request, it is a good plan to bottle off
sufficient dressing for a few days’ consumption,
as, thereby, much time and
trouble are saved. If kept in a cool
place, it will remain good for 4 or 5 days.</p>

<p><i>Poetic Recipe for Salad.</i>—The Rev.
Sydney Smith’s recipe.</p>

<h3>SALAD, French.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Lettuces; a little chopped
burnet. To every 4 tablespoonfuls of
oil allow 1½ of either Tarragon or plain
<i>French vinegar</i>; 1 saltspoonful of salt,
½ saltspoonful of pepper. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
the lettuces, shake them in a cloth, and
cut them into inch lengths. Put the
lettuce into a salad-bowl, sprinkle over
the chopped burnet, and mix these well
together. Put the salt and pepper into
the salad-spoon, moisten with the vinegar,
disperse this amongst the salad, pour the
oil over, and mix the whole well together
for at least five minutes, when the preparation
will be ready for table. This is
the very simple and expeditious mode of
preparing a salad generally adopted by
our French neighbours, who are so noted
for the delicious manner in which they
dress their bowl. Success will not be
obtained if the right vinegar is not procured,
therefore we advise our friends
who wish to excel in making a French
salad to procure a bottle of the best
French vinegar, flavoured with Tarragon
or not as the taste may dictate. Those
persons living in or near London, can
purchase the vinegar of Messrs. Crosse
&amp; Blackwell, Soho Square, at whose establishment
the quality of this important
ingredient in a salad can be relied on.
<i>Time.</i>—To be stirred at least 5 minutes
after all the ingredients are put in.
<i>Sufficient.</i> Allow 2 moderate-sized
lettuces for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>
Plentiful in summer, but scarce and
dear during the winter season.</p>


<h3>SALAD, Fresh Fruit (A Dessert
Dish).</h3>

<p><i>Mode.</i>—Fruit salads are made by
stripping the fruit from the stalks, piling
it on a dish, and sprinkling over it finely
pounded sugar. They may be made of
strawberries, raspberries, currants, or
any of these fruits mixed; peaches also
make a very good salad. After the sugar
is sprinkled over, about 6 large tablespoonfuls
of wine or brandy, or 3 tablespoonfuls
of liqueur, should be poured in
the middle of the fruit; and, when the
flavour is liked, a little pounded cinnamon
may be added. In helping the
fruit, it should be lightly stirred, that
the wine and sugar may be equally distributed.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—1½ pint of fruit,
with 3 oz. of pounded sugar, for 4 or 5
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in summer.</p>


<h3>SALAD, Red Cabbage.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A small red cabbage, 2
teaspoonfuls of salt, ½ pint of vinegar, 3
teaspoonfuls of oil, a small quantity of
cayenne pepper. <i>Mode.</i>—Take off the
outside leaves of a fresh red cabbage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and cut the remainder very finely into
small thin slices. Mix with the cabbage
the above salad ingredients, and let it
remain for two days, when it will be fit
for use. This salad will keep very well
for a few days. The quantity of the
ingredients may of course be a little
varied, according to taste. <i>Time.</i>—2
days. <i>Average cost</i>, from 2<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i>
each. <i>Seasonable</i> in July and August.</p>


<h3>SALAD, Summer.</h3>

<div class="caption">SALAD IN BOWL.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 lettuces, 2 handfuls of
mustard-and-cress, 10 young radishes, a
few slices of cucumber. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the
herbs be as fresh as possible for a salad,
and, if at all stale or dead-looking, let
them lie in water for an hour or two,
which will very much refresh them.
Wash and
carefully pick
them over,
remove any
decayed or
worm-eaten
leaves, and
drain them
thoroughly
by swinging
them gently in a clean cloth. With a
silver knife, cut the lettuces into small
pieces, and the radishes and cucumbers
into thin slices; arrange all these ingredients
lightly on a dish, with the
mustard-and-cress, and pour under, but
not over the salad, either of the salad
dressings, and do not stir it up until it is
to be eaten. It may be garnished with
hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices, sliced
cucumbers, nasturtiums, cut vegetable-flowers,
and many other things that
taste will always suggest to make a pretty
and elegant dish. In making a good
salad, care must be taken to have the
herbs freshly gathered, and <i>thoroughly
drained</i> before the sauce is added to
them, or it will be watery and thin.
Young spring onions, cut small, are by
many persons considered an improvement
to salads; but, before these are
added, the cook should always consult
the taste of her employer. Slices of cold
meat or poultry added to a salad make a
convenient and quickly-made summer
luncheon-dish; or cold fish, flaked,
will also be found exceedingly nice,
mixed with it. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> for a
salad for 5 or 6 persons; but more expensive
when the herbs are forced.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from May to September.</p>


<h3>SALAD, Winter.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Endive, mustard-and-cress,
boiled beetroot, 3 or 4 hard-boiled
eggs, celery. <i>Mode.</i>—The above ingredients
form the principal constituents
of a winter salad, and may be converted
into a very pretty dish, by nicely contrasting
the various colours, and by
tastefully garnishing it. Shred the celery
into thin pieces, after having carefully
washed and cut away all worm-eaten
pieces; cleanse the endive and mustard-and-cress
free from grit, and arrange
these high in the centre of a salad-bowl
or dish; garnish with the hard-boiled
eggs and beetroot, both of which should
be cut in slices; and pour into the dish,
but not over the salad, either of the salad
dressings. Never dress a salad long
before it is required for table, as, by
standing, it loses its freshness and pretty
crisp and light appearance; the sauce,
however, may always be prepared a few
hours beforehand, and when required to
use, the herbs laid lightly over it. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> for a salad for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from the end of September to March.</p>


<h3>SALMON (à la Genévése).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 slices of salmon, 2
chopped shalots, a little parsley, a small
bunch of herbs, 2 bay-leaves, 2 carrots,
pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste,
4 tablespoonfuls of Madeira, ½ pint of
white stock, thickening of butter and
flour, 1 teaspoonful of essence of anchovies,
the juice of 1 lemon, cayenne
and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub the
bottom of a stewpan over with butter,
and put in the shalots, herbs, bay-leaves,
carrots, mace, and seasoning;
stir them for 10 minutes over a clear
fire, and add the Madeira or sherry;
simmer gently for ½ hour, and strain
through a sieve over the fish, which stew
in this gravy. As soon as the fish is
sufficiently cooked, take away all the
liquor, except a little to keep the salmon
moist, and put it into another stewpan;
add the stock, thicken with butter and
flour, and put in the anchovies, lemon-juice,
cayenne, and salt; lay the salmon
on a hot dish, pour over it part of the
sauce, and serve the remainder in a
tureen. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
for this quantity, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
4 or 5 persons.</p>


<h3>SALMON, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of salt to each
gallon of water,—sufficient water to
cover the fish. <i>Mode.</i>—Scale and clean
the fish, and be particular that no blood
is left inside; lay it in the fish-kettle with
sufficient cold water to cover it, adding
salt in the above proportion. Bring it
quickly to a boil, take off all the scum,
and let it simmer gently till the fish is
done, which will be when the meat separates
easily from the bone. Experience
alone can teach the cook to fix the time
for boiling fish; but it is especially to be
remembered, that it should never be
under-dressed, as then nothing is more
unwholesome. Neither let it remain in
the kettle after it is sufficiently cooked,
as that would render it insipid, watery,
and colourless. Drain it, and if not
wanted for a few minutes, keep it warm
by means of warm cloths laid over it.
Serve on a hot napkin, garnish with cut
lemon and parsley, and send lobster or
shrimp sauce, and plain melted butter to
table with it. A dish of dressed cucumber
usually accompanies this fish. <i>Time.</i>—8
minutes to each lb. for large thick
salmon; 6 minutes for thin fish. <i>Average
cost</i>, in full season, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per lb.
<i>Sufficient</i>, ½ lb., or rather less, for
each person. <i>Seasonable</i> from April to
August.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Cut lemon should be put on
the table with this fish; and a little of
the juice squeezed over it is regarded by
many persons as a most agreeable addition.
Boiled peas are also, by some connoisseurs,
considered especially adapted
to be served with salmon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Choose Salmon.</span>—To be good,
the belly should be firm and thick,
which may readily be ascertained by feeling
it with the thumb and finger. The
circumstance of this fish having <i>red</i> gills,
though given as a standing rule in most
cookery-books, as a sign of its goodness,
is not at all to be relied on, as this
quality can be easily given them by
art.</p>


<h3>SALMON AND CAPER SAUCE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 slices of salmon, ¼ lb.
butter, ½ teaspoonful of chopped parsley,
1 shalot; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg
to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Lay the salmon
in a baking-dish, place pieces of butter
over it, and add the other ingredients,
rubbing a little of the seasoning into the
fish; baste it frequently; when done,
take it out and drain for a minute or
two; lay it in a dish, pour caper sauce
over it, and serve. Salmon dressed in
this way, with tomato sauce, is very
delicious. <i>Time.</i>—About ¾ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4
or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from April to
August.</p>


<h3>SALMON, Collared.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A piece of salmon, say
3 lb., a high seasoning of salt, pounded
mace, and pepper; water and vinegar,
3 bay-leaves. <i>Mode.</i>—Split the fish;
scale, bone, and wash it thoroughly
clean; wipe it, and rub in the seasoning
inside and out; roll it up, and bind
firmly; lay it in a kettle, cover it with
vinegar and water (1/3 vinegar, in proportion
to the water); add the bay-leaves
and a good seasoning of salt and
whole pepper, and simmer till done. Do
not remove the lid. Serve with melted
butter or anchovy sauce. For preserving
the collared fish, boil up the
liquor in which it was cooked, and add
a little more vinegar. Pour over when
cold. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour, or rather more.</p>


<h3>SALMON, Crimped.</h3>

<p>Salmon is frequently dressed in this
way at many fashionable tables, but
must be very fresh, and cut into slices
2 or 3 inches thick. Lay these in cold
salt and water for 1 hour; have ready
some boiling water, salted, and well
skimmed; put in the fish, and simmer
gently for ¼ hour, or rather more; should
it be very thick, garnish the same as
boiled salmon, and serve with the same
sauces. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour, more or less,
according to size.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Never use vinegar with salmon,
as it spoils the taste and colour of the
fish.</p>


<h3>SALMON, Curried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Any remains of boiled
salmon, ¾ pint of strong or medium
stock, 1 onion, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder,
1 teaspoonful of Harvey’s sauce,
1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 oz. of
butter, the juice of ½ lemon, cayenne
and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
onions into small pieces, and fry them of
a pale brown in the butter; add all the
ingredients but the salmon, and simmer
gently till the onion is tender, occasionally
stirring the contents; cut the salmon
into small square pieces, carefully take
away all skin and bone, lay it in the
stewpan, and let it gradually heat through;
but do not allow it to boil long. <i>Time.</i>—¾
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the
cold fish, 9<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>SALMON CUTLETS.</h3>

<p>Cut the slices 1 inch thick, and season
them with pepper and salt; butter a
sheet of white paper, lay each slice on a
separate piece, with their ends twisted;
broil gently over a clear fire, and serve
with anchovy or caper sauce. When
higher seasoning is required, add a few
chopped herbs and a little spice. <i>Time.</i>—5
to 10 minutes.</p>


<h3>SALMON, Pickled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Salmon, ½ oz. of whole
pepper, ½ oz. of whole allspice, 1 teaspoonful
of salt, 2 bay-leaves, equal
quantities of vinegar and the liquor in
which the fish was boiled. <i>Mode.</i>—After
the fish comes from table, lay it in a
nice dish with a cover to it, as it should
be excluded from the air, and take away
the bone; boil the liquor and vinegar
with the other ingredients for 10 minutes,
and let it stand to get cold; pour it over
the salmon, and in 12 hours this will be
fit for the table. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes.</p>


<h3>SALMON, Potted.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Salmon, pounded mace,
cloves, and pepper to taste; 3 bay-leaves,
¼ lb. butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Skin the salmon,
and clean it thoroughly by wiping with a
cloth (water would spoil it); cut it into
square pieces, which rub with salt; let
them remain till thoroughly drained,
then lay them in a dish with the other
ingredients, and bake. When quite
done, drain them from the gravy, press
into pots for use, and, when cold, pour
over it clarified butter. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour.</p>


<h3>SALMON, to Cure.</h3>

<p>This process consists in splitting the
fish, rubbing it with salt, and then putting
it in to pickle in tubs provided for
the purpose. Here it is kept for about
six weeks, when it is taken out, pressed
and packed in casks, with layers of salt.</p>


<h3>SALMON, to Help.</h3>

<p>First run the knife quite down to the
bone, along the side of the fish, from
<i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, and also from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>. Then help
the thick part lengthwise, that is, in the
direction of the lines from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>; and
the thin part breadthwise, that is, in the
direction of the lines from <i>e</i> to <i>f</i>, as
shown in the engraving. A slice of the
thick part should always be accompanied
by a smaller piece of the thin from the
belly, where lies the fat of the fish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/illus-301.jpg" width="345" height="181" alt="diagram of salmon sliced" />
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Many persons, in carving
salmon, make the mistake of slicing
the thick part of this fish in the opposite
direction to that we have stated; and
thus, by the breaking of the flakes, the
beauty of its appearance is destroyed.</p>


<h3>SALSIFY, to Dress.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Salsify; to each ½ gallon
of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of
salt, 1 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of
lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Scrape the roots
gently, so as to strip them only of their
outside peel; cut them into pieces about
4 inches long, and, as they are peeled,
throw them into water with which has
been mixed a little lemon-juice, to prevent
their discolouring. Put them into
boiling water, with salt, butter, and
lemon-juice in the above proportion, and
let them boil rapidly until tender; try
them with a fork; and, when it penetrates
easily, they are done. Drain the
salsify, and serve with a good white sauce
or French melted butter. <i>Time.</i>—30 to
50 minutes. <i>Seasonable</i> in winter.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This vegetable may be also
boiled, sliced, and fried in batter of a
nice brown. When crisp and a good
colour, they should be served with fried
parsley in the centre of the dish, and a
little fine salt sprinkled over the salsify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>


<h3>SANDWICHES, Victoria.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs; their weight in
pounded sugar, butter, and flour; ¼ saltspoonful
of salt, a layer of any kind of
jam or marmalade. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat the
butter to a cream; dredge in the flour
and pounded sugar; stir these ingredients
well together, and add the eggs,
which should be previously thoroughly
whisked. When the mixture has been
well beaten for about 10 minutes, butter
a Yorkshire-pudding tin, pour in the
batter, and bake it in a moderate oven
for 20 minutes. Let it cool, spread one
half of the cake with a layer of nice preserve,
place over it the other half of the
cake, press the pieces slightly together,
and then cut it into long finger-pieces;
pile them in cross-bars, on a glass dish,
and serve. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3><a id="SAUCES"></a>SAUCES, General Remarks upon.</h3>

<p>The preparation and appearance of
sauces and gravies are of the highest
consequence, and in nothing does the
talent and taste of the cook more display
itself. Their special adaptability to the
various viands they are to accompany
cannot be too much studied, in order
that they may harmonize and blend with
them as perfectly, so to speak, as does a
pianoforte accompaniment with the voice
of the singer.</p>

<p>The general basis of most gravies and
some sauces is the same stock as that
used for soups; and, by the employment
of these, with, perhaps, an additional
slice of ham, a little spice, a few herbs,
and a slight flavouring from some cold
sauce or ketchup, very nice gravies may
be made for a very small expenditure.
A milt (either of a bullock or sheep), the
shank-end of mutton that has already
been dressed, and the necks and feet of
poultry may all be advantageously used
for gravy, where much is not required.
It may, then, be established as a rule,
that there exists no necessity for good
gravies to be expensive, and that there
is no occasion, as many would have the
world believe, to buy ever so many pounds
of fresh meat, in order to furnish an ever
so little quantity of gravy.</p>

<p>Brown sauces, generally speaking,
should scarcely be so thick as white
sauces; and it is well to bear in mind,
that all those which are intended to mask
the various dishes of poultry or meat,
should be of a sufficient consistency to
slightly adhere to the fowls or joints
over which they are poured. For browning
and thickening sauces, &amp;c., browned
flour may be properly employed.</p>

<p>Sauces should possess a decided character;
and whether sharp or sweet,
savoury or plain, they should carry out
their names in a distinct manner, although,
of course, not so much flavoured
as to make them too piquant on the one
hand, or too mawkish on the other.</p>

<p>Gravies and sauces should be sent to
table very hot; and there is all the more
necessity for the cook to see to this
point, as, from their being usually served
in small quantities, they are more liable
to cool quickly than if they were in a
larger body. Those sauces, of which
cream or eggs form a component part,
should be well stirred, as soon as those
ingredients are added to them, and must
never be allowed to boil; as, in that case,
they would instantly curdle.</p>


<h3>SAUCE à L’AURORE, for Trout,
Soles, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The spawn of 1 lobster,
1 oz. of butter, ½ pint of Béchamel, the
juice of ½ lemon, a high seasoning of salt
and cayenne. <i>Mode.</i>—Take the spawn
and pound it in a mortar with the
butter, until quite smooth, and work it
through a hair sieve. Put the Béchamel
into a stewpan, add the pounded spawn,
the lemon-juice, which must be strained,
and a plentiful seasoning of cayenne and
salt; let it just simmer, but do not allow
it to boil, or the beautiful red colour of
the sauce will be spoiled. A small spoonful
of anchovy essence may be added at
pleasure. <i>Time.</i>—1 minute to simmer.
<i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for a pair of large soles. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>SAUCE à la MATELOTE, for Fish.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of Espagnole, 3
onions, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom
ketchup, ½ glass of port wine, a bunch
of sweet herbs, ½ bay-leaf, salt and
pepper to taste, 1 clove, 2 berries of
allspice, a little liquor in which the fish
has been boiled, lemon-juice, and anchovy
sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice and fry the
onions of a nice brown colour, and put
them into a stewpan with the Espagnole,
ketchup, wine, and a little liquor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
which the fish has been boiled. Add the
seasoning, herbs, and spices, and simmer
gently for 10 minutes, stirring well the
whole time; strain it through a fine hair
sieve, put in the lemon-juice and anchovy
sauce, and pour it over the fish. This
sauce may be very much enriched by
putting in a few small quenelles, or forcemeat
balls made of fish, and also glazed
onions or mushrooms. These, however,
should not be added to the matelote till
it is dished. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This sauce originally took its
name as being similar to that which the
French sailor (<i>matelot</i>) employed as a
relish to the fish he caught and ate. In
some cases cider and perry were substituted
for the wine. The Norman <i>matelotes</i>
were very celebrated.</p>


<h3>SAUCE ALLEMANDE,or German
Sauce.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of sauce tournée,
the yolks of 2 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the
sauce into a stewpan, heat it, and stir
to it the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, which
have been previously strained. Let it
just simmer, but not boil, or the eggs
will curdle; and after they are added to
the sauce, it must be stirred without
ceasing. This sauce is a general favourite,
and is used for many made dishes.
<i>Time.</i>—1 minute to simmer. <i>Average
cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>SAUCE ARISTOCRATIQUE (a
Store Sauce).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Green walnuts. To every
pint of juice, 1 lb. of anchovies, 1 drachm
of cloves, 1 drachm of mace, 1 drachm
of Jamaica ginger bruised, 8 shalots. To
every pint of the boiled liquor, ½ pint of
vinegar, ¼ pint of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls
of soy. <i>Mode.</i>—Pound the
walnuts in a mortar, squeeze out the
juice through a strainer, and let it stand
to settle. Pour off the clear juice, and to
every pint of it, add anchovies, spices,
and cloves in the above proportion. Boil
all these together till the anchovies are
dissolved, then strain the juice again, put
in the shalots (8 to every pint), and boil
again. To every pint of the boiled liquor
add vinegar, wine, and soy, in the above
quantities, and bottle off for use. Cork
well and seal the corks. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this sauce from the beginning to
the middle of July, when walnuts are in
perfection for sauces and pickling.
<i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for a quart.</p>


<h3>SAUCE, Benton (to serve with
Hot or Cold Roast Beef).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 tablespoonful of
scraped horseradish, 1 teaspoonful of
made mustard, 1 teaspoonful of pounded
sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.
<i>Mode.</i>—Grate or scrape the horseradish
very fine, and mix it with the other ingredients,
which must be all well blended
together; serve in a tureen. With cold
meat, this sauce is a very good substitute
for pickles. <i>Average cost</i> for this quantity,
2<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>SAUCE, Mango Chetney, Bengal
Recipe for Making.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of moist sugar,
¾ lb. of salt, ¼ lb. of garlic, ¼ lb. of
onions, ¾ lb. of powdered ginger, ¼ lb. of
dried chilies, ¾ lb. of mustard-seed, ¾ lb.
of stoned raisins, 2 bottles of best
vinegar, 30 large unripe sour apples.
<i>Mode.</i>—The sugar must be made into
syrup; the garlic, onions, and ginger be
finely pounded in a mortar; the mustard-seed
be washed in cold vinegar, and
dried in the sun; the apples be peeled,
cored, and sliced, and boiled in a bottle
and a half of the vinegar. When all this
is done, and the apples are quite cold,
put them into a large pan, and gradually
mix the whole of the rest of the ingredients,
including the remaining half-bottle
of vinegar. It must be well stirred
until the whole is thoroughly blended,
and then put into bottles for use. Tie a
piece of wet bladder over the mouths of
the bottles, after they are well corked.
This chetney is very superior to any
which can be bought, and one trial will
prove it to be delicious.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This recipe was given by a
native to an English lady, who had long
been a resident in India, and who, since
her return to her native country, has
become quite celebrated amongst her
friends for the excellence of this Eastern
relish.</p>


<h3>SAUCE, Bread (to serve with Roast
Turkey, Fowl, Game, &amp;c).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of milk, ¾ lb. of
the crumb of a stale loaf, 1 onion;
pounded mace, cayenne, and salt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
taste; 1 oz. of butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel and
quarter the onion, and simmer it in the
milk till perfectly tender. Break the
bread, which should be stale, into small
pieces, carefully picking out any hard or
side pieces; put it in a very clean saucepan,
strain the milk over it, cover it up,
and let it remain for an hour to soak.
Now beat it up with a fork very smoothly,
add a seasoning of pounded mace,
cayenne, and salt, with 1 oz. of butter;
give the whole one boil, and serve. To
enrich this sauce, a small quantity of
cream may be added just before sending
it to table. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 1¾ hour.
<i>Average cost</i> for this quantity, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
to serve with a turkey, pair of
fowls, or brace of partridges.</p>


<h3>SAUCE, Bread (to serve with Roast
Turkey, Fowl, Game, &amp;c).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Giblets of poultry, ¾ lb.
of the crumb of a stale loaf, 1 onion,
12 whole peppers, 1 blade of mace, salt
to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream or
melted butter, 1 pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the giblets, with the head, neck,
legs, &amp;c., into a stewpan; add the onion,
pepper, mace, salt, and rather more than
1 pint of water. Let this simmer for an
hour, when strain the liquor over the
bread, which should be previously grated
or broken into small pieces. Cover up
the saucepan, and leave it for an hour by
the side of the fire; then beat the sauce
up with a fork until no lumps remain,
and the whole is nice and smooth. Let it
boil for 3 or 4 minutes; keep stirring it
until it is rather thick; when add 3 tablespoonfuls
of good melted butter or cream,
and serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—2¼ hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3>SAUCE, Christopher North’s, for
Meat or Game.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 glass of port wine, 2
tablespoonfuls of Harvey’s sauce, 1 dessertspoonful
of mushroom ketchup, ditto
of pounded white sugar, 1 tablespoonful
of lemon juice, ½ teaspoonful of cayenne
pepper, ditto of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix all the
ingredients thoroughly together, and
beat the sauce gradually, by placing the
vessel in which it is made in a saucepan
of boiling water. Do not allow it to boil,
and serve directly it is ready. This
sauce, if bottled immediately, will keep
good for a fortnight, and will be found
excellent.</p>


<h3>SAUCE, Dutch, for Fish.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ teaspoonful of flour,
2 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar,
4 tablespoonfuls of water, the yolks
of 2 eggs, the juice of ½ lemon; salt to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Put all the ingredients,
except the lemon-juice, into a stewpan;
set it over the fire, and keep continually
stirring. When it is sufficiently thick,
take it off, as it should not boil. If,
however, it happens to curdle, strain the
sauce through a tammy, add the lemon-juice,
and serve. Tarragon vinegar may
be used instead of plain, and, by many,

a pulp, strew some salt over them, and
let them remain thus for two or three
days, occasionally stirring and moving
them about. Press out the juice, and
to <i>each quart</i> of walnut-liquor allow the

<h3>SAUSAGE-MEAT STUFFING
FOR TURKEYS.</h3>

1 small tablespoonful of minced sage, 1

other ingredients, taking care that the
whole is thoroughly incorporated. Moisten
with the egg, and the stuffing will be
ready for use. Equal quantities of this
stuffing and forcemeat will be found to
answer very well, as the herbs, lemon-peel,
&amp;c., in the latter, impart a very
delicious flavour to the sausage-meat.
As preparations, however, like stuffings
and forcemeats, are matters to be decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
by individual palates, they must be
left, to a great extent, to the discrimination
of the cook, who should study her
employer’s taste in this as in every other
respect. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for a small turkey.</p>


<h3>SAUSAGE OR MEAT ROLLS.</h3>

1 lb. of puff-paste; roll it out
to the thickness of about ½ inch, or
rather less, and divide it into 8, 10,
or 12 squares, according to the size
the rolls are intended to be. Place
some sausage-meat on one-half of each
square, wet the edges of the paste,
and fold it over the meat; slightly
press the edges together, and trim
them neatly with a knife. Brush the
rolls over with the yolk of an egg, and
bake them in a well-heated oven for
about ½ hour, or longer should they be
very large. The remains of cold chicken
and ham, minced and seasoned, as also
cold veal or beef, make very good
rolls. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour, or longer if the
rolls are large. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient.</i>—1 lb. of paste for 10 or 12

possible; season with pepper, salt, and
spices, and mix the whole well together.
Make it into flat cakes, and
fry of a nice brown. Many persons
pound the meat in a mortar after it is
chopped; but this is not necessary
when the meat is minced finely. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>SAUSAGES, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sausages: a small piece
of butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Prick the sausages
with a fork (this prevents them from
bursting), and put them into a frying-pan
with a small piece of butter. Keep
moving the pan about, and turn the
sausages 3 or 4 times. In from 10
to 12 minutes they will be sufficiently
cooked, unless they are <i>very
large</i>, when a little more time should
be allowed for them. Dish them with
or without a piece of toast under them,
and serve very hot. In some counties,
sausages are boiled and served on toast.
They should be plunged into boiling
water, and simmered for about 10 or
12 minutes. <i>Time.</i>—10 to 12 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Good
from September to March.</p>

<div class="caption">FRIED SAUSAGES.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Sometimes, in close warm
weather, sausages very soon turn sour;
to prevent this, put them in the oven
for a few minutes with a small piece
of butter to keep them moist. When
wanted for table, they will not require
so long frying as uncooked sausages.</p>

water highly salted, put in the fish, and
boil till it is done. Drain well, remove the
string, dish on a hot napkin, and serve
with the same sauces as above. Skate
should never be eaten out of season, as
it is liable to produce diarrhœa and other
diseases. It may be dished without a

of pepper, 1 sliced onion, a small
bunch of parsley, 2 bay-leaves, 2 or 3
sprigs of thyme, sufficient water to cover
the fish. <i>Mode.</i>—Put in a fish-kettle all
the above ingredients, and simmer the
skate in them till tender. When it is
done, skin it neatly, and pour over it
some of the liquor in which it has been
boiling. Drain it, put it on a hot dish,
pour over it caper sauce, and send
some of the latter to table in a tureen.
<i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> per lb.
<i>Seasonable</i> from August to April.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Skate may also be served with
onion sauce, or parsley and butter.</p>


<h3>SKATE, Small, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Skate, sufficient vinegar
to cover them, salt and pepper to taste,
1 sliced onion, a small bunch of parsley,
the juice of ½ lemon, hot dripping.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse the skate, lay them in a
dish, with sufficient vinegar to cover
them; add the salt, pepper, onion, parsley,
and lemon-juice, and let the fish
remain in this pickle for ½ hour. Then
drain them well, flour them, and fry of
a nice brown, in hot dripping. They
may be served either with or without
sauce. Skate is not good if dressed too
fresh, unless it is crimped; it should,
therefore, be kept for a day, but not
long enough to produce a disagreeable
smell. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> from August
to April.</p>


<h3>SMELTS.</h3>

<p>When good, this fish is of a fine
silvery appearance, and when alive,
their backs are of a dark brown shade,
which, after death, fades to a light fawn.
They ought to have a refreshing fragrance,
resembling that of a cucumber.</p>


<h3>SMELTS, to Bake.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 smelts, bread-crumbs,
¼ lb. of fresh butter, 2 blades of pounded
mace; salt and cayenne to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash,
and dry the fish thoroughly in
a cloth, and arrange them nicely in a
flat baking-dish. Cover them with fine
bread-crumbs, and place little pieces of
butter all over them. Season and bake
for 15 minutes. Just before serving,
add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and garnish
with fried parsley and cut lemon.
<i>Time.</i>—¼ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> per
dozen. <i>Seasonable</i> from October to May.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 6 persons.</p>


<h3>SMELTS, to Fry.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Egg and bread-crumbs,
a little flour; boiling lard. <i>Mode.</i>—Smelts
should be very fresh, and not
washed more than is necessary to clean
them. Dry them in a cloth, lightly
flour, dip them in egg, and sprinkle
over with very fine bread-crumbs, and
put them into boiling lard. Fry of a
nice pale brown, and be careful not to
take off the light roughness of the
crumbs, or their beauty will be spoiled.
Dry them before the fire on a drainer,
and serve with plain melted butter.
This fish is often used as a garnishing.
<i>Time.</i>—5 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> per
dozen. <i>Seasonable</i> from October to May.</p>


<h3>SNIPES, to Dress.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 195px;">
<img src="images/illus-315.jpg" width="195" height="81" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">ROAST SNIPE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Snipes, butter, flour,
toast. <i>Mode.</i>—These, like woodcocks,
should be dressed without being drawn.
Pluck, and wipe them outside, and truss
them with the head under the wing,
having previously skinned that and the
neck. Twist the legs at the first joint,
press the feet
upon the thighs,
and pass a skewer
through these
and the body.
Place four on a
skewer, tie them on to the jack or spit,
and roast before a clear fire for about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
¼ hour. Put some pieces of buttered
toast into the dripping-pan to catch the
trails; flour and froth the birds nicely,
dish the pieces of toast with the snipes
on them, and pour round, but not over
them, a little good brown gravy. They
should be sent to table very hot and
expeditiously, or they will not be worth
eating. <i>Time.</i>—About ¼ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> the brace. <i>Sufficient.</i>—4
for a dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from November
to February.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Ortolans are trussed and dressed
in the same manner.</p>


<h3>SNIPES, to Carve.</h3>

<p>One of these small but delicious birds
may be given, whole, to a gentleman;
but, in helping a lady,
it will be better to cut
them quite through the
centre, from 1 to 2,
completely dividing
them into equal and like portions, and
put only one half on the plate.</p>

<h3>SNOW-CAKE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of <i>tous-les-mois</i>, ¼ lb.
of white pounded sugar, ¼ lb. of fresh
or washed salt butter, 1 egg, the juice of
1 lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat the butter to a
cream; then add the egg, previously well
beaten, and then the other ingredients;
if the mixture is not light, add another
egg, and beat for ¼ hour, until it turns
white and light. Line a flat tin, with
raised edges, with a sheet of buttered
paper; pour in the cake, and put it into
the oven. It must be rather slow, and
the cake not allowed to brown at all. If
the oven is properly heated, 1 to 1¼ hour
will be found long enough to bake it. Let
it cool a few minutes, then with a clean
sharp knife cut it into small square pieces,
which should be gently removed to a large
flat dish to cool before putting away.
This will keep for several weeks. <i>Time.</i>—1
to 1¼ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>SNOW-CAKE (a genuine Scotch
Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of arrowroot, ½ lb.
of pounded white sugar, ½ lb. of butter,
the whites of 6 eggs; flavouring to taste,
of essence of almonds, or vanilla, or
lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat the butter to a
cream; stir in the sugar and arrowroot
gradually, at the same time beating the
mixture. Whisk the whites of the eggs
to a stiff froth, add them to the other ingredients,
and beat well for 20 minutes.
Put in whichever of the above flavourings
may be preferred; pour the cake
into a buttered mould or tin, and bake it
in a moderate oven from 1 to 1½ hour.
<i>Time.</i>—1 to 1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, with
the best Bermuda arrowroot, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
with St. Vincent ditto, 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
to make a moderate-sized cake. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>SODA-BISCUITS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, ½ lb. of
pounded loaf sugar, ¼ lb. of fresh butter,
2 eggs, 1 small teaspoonful of carbonate
of soda. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the flour (which
should be perfectly dry) into a basin;
rub in the butter, add the sugar, and
mix these ingredients well together.
Whisk the eggs, stir them into the
mixture, and beat it well, until everything
is well incorporated. Quickly stir
in the soda, roll the paste out until it is
about ½ inch thick, cut it into small
round cakes with a tin cutter, and bake
them from 12 to 18 minutes in rather a
brisk oven. After the soda is added,
great expedition is necessary in rolling
and cutting out the paste, and in putting
the biscuits <i>immediately</i> into the oven,
or they will be heavy. <i>Time.</i>—12 to 18
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to
make about 3 dozen cakes. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>SODA-BREAD.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every 2 lbs. of flour
allow 1 teaspoonful of tartaric acid, 1 teaspoonful
of salt, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate
of soda, 2 breakfast-cupfuls of
cold milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the tartaric acid
and salt be reduced to the finest possible
powder; then mix them well with the
flour. Dissolve the soda in the milk,
and pour it several times from one basin
to another, before adding it to the flour.
Work the whole quickly into a light
dough, divide it into 2 loaves, and put
them into a well-heated oven immediately,
and bake for an hour. Sour
milk or buttermilk may be used, but
then a little less acid will be needed.
<i>Time.</i>—1 hour.</p>


<h3>SODA-CAKE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of butter, 1 lb. of
flour, ½ lb. of currants, ½ lb. of moist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
sugar, 1 teacupful of milk, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoonful
of carbonate of soda. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub
the butter into the flour, add the
currants and sugar, and mix these ingredients
well together. Whisk the eggs
well, stir them to the flour, &amp;c., with the
milk, in which the soda should be previously
dissolved, and beat the whole up
together with a wooden spoon or beater.
Divide the dough into two pieces, put
them into buttered moulds or cake-tins,
and bake in a moderate oven for nearly
an hour. The mixture must be extremely
well beaten up, and not allowed to stand
after the soda is added to it, but must be
placed in the oven immediately. Great
care must also be taken that the cakes
are quite done through, which may be
ascertained by thrusting a knife into the
middle of them: if the blade looks bright
when withdrawn, they are done. If the
tops acquire too much colour before the
inside is sufficiently baked, cover them
over with a piece of clean white paper,
to prevent them from burning. <i>Time.</i>—1
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
to make 2 small cakes. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>SOLE OR COD PIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold boiled
sole or cod, seasoning to taste of pepper,
salt, and pounded mace, 1 dozen oysters
to each lb. of fish, 3 tablespoonfuls of
white stock, 1 teacupful of cream thickened
with flour, puff paste. <i>Mode.</i>—Clear
the fish from the bones, lay it in a
pie-dish, and between each layer put a
few oysters and a little seasoning; add
the stock, and, when liked, a small quantity
of butter; cover with puff paste, and
bake for ½ hour. Boil the cream with
sufficient flour to thicken it; pour in the
pie, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average
cost</i> for this quantity, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>SOLES, to Choose.</h3>

<p>This fish should be both thick and firm.
If the skin is difficult to be taken off,
and the flesh looks grey, it is good.</p>


<h3>SOLES, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 soles, ¼ lb. of butter,
egg, and bread-crumbs, minced parsley,
1 glass of sherry, lemon-juice; cayenne
and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Clean, skin,
and well wash the fish, and dry them
thoroughly in a cloth. Brush them
over with egg, sprinkle with bread-crumbs
mixed with a little minced parsley,
lay them in a large flat baking-dish,
white side uppermost; or if it will not
hold the two soles, they may each be
laid on a dish by itself; but they must
not be put one on the top of the other.
Melt the butter, and pour it over the
whole, and bake for 20 minutes. Take a
portion of the gravy that flows from the
fish, add the wine, lemon-juice, and
seasoning, give it one boil, skim, pour it
<i>under</i> the fish, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per
pair. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>SOLES, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. salt to each gallon
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse and wash
the fish carefully, cut off the fins, but do
not skin it. Lay it in a fish-kettle, with
sufficient cold water to cover it, salted
in the above proportion. Let it gradually
come to a boil, and keep it simmering
for a few minutes, according to
the size of the fish. Dish it on a hot
napkin after well draining it, and garnish
with parsley and cut lemon. Shrimp, or
lobster sauce, and plain melted butter,
are usually sent to table with this dish.
<i>Time.</i>—After the water boils, 7 minutes
for a middling-sized sole. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per pair. <i>Sufficient.</i>—1 middling-sized
sole for two persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>SOLES, Boiled or Fried, to Help.</h3>

<p>The usual way of helping this fish is
to cut it right through, bone and all,
distributing it in nice and not too large
pieces. A moderately-sized sole will be
sufficient for three slices; namely, the
head, middle, and tail. The guests
should be asked which of these they
prefer. A small one will only give two
slices. If the sole is very large, the
upper side may be raised from the bone,
and then divided into pieces; and the
under side afterwards served in the same
way.</p>

<p>In helping Filleted Soles, one fillet is
given to each person.</p>


<h3>SOLES, Filleted, à l’Italienne.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 soles; salt, pepper,
and grated nutmeg to taste; egg and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
bread-crumbs, butter, the juice of 1
lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Skin, and carefully wash
the soles, separate the meat from the
bone, and divide each fillet in two pieces.
Brush them over with white of egg,
sprinkle with bread-crumbs and seasoning,
and put them in a baking-dish.
Place small pieces of butter over the
whole, and bake for ½ hour. When they
are nearly done, squeeze the juice of a
lemon over them, and serve on a dish,
with Italian sauce (<i>see</i> <a href="#SAUCES">Sauces</a>) poured
over. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per pair. <i>Sufficient</i> for
4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at anytime.</p>

<p>Whiting may be dressed in the same
manner, and will be found very delicious.</p>


<h3>SOLES, Fricasseed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 middling-sized soles,
1 small one, ½ teaspoonful of chopped
lemon-peel, 1 teaspoonful of chopped
parsley, a little grated bread; salt, pepper,
and nutmeg to taste; 1 egg, 2 oz.
butter, ½ pint of good gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls
of port wine, cayenne and
lemon-juice to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Fry the
soles of a nice brown, and drain them
well from fat. Take all the meat from
the small sole, chop it fine, and mix
with it the lemon-peel, parsley, bread,
and seasoning; work altogether, with
the yolk of an egg and the butter; make
this into small balls, and fry them.
Thicken the gravy with a dessertspoonful
of flour, add the port wine, cayenne,
and lemon-juice; lay in the 2 soles and
balls; let them simmer gently for 5
minutes; serve hot, and garnish with
cut lemon. <i>Time.</i>—10 minutes to fry the
soles. <i>Average cost</i> for this quantity, 3<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>SOLES, Fried Filleted.</h3>

<p>Soles for filleting should be large, as
the flesh can be more easily separated
from the bones, and there is less waste.
Skin and wash the fish, and raise the
meat carefully from the bones, and divide
it into nice handsome pieces. The
more usual way is to roll the fillets, after
dividing each one in two pieces, and
either bind them round with twine, or
run a small skewer through them. Brush
over with egg, and cover with bread-crumbs;
fry them as directed in the
foregoing recipe, and garnish with fried
parsley and cut lemon. When a pretty
dish is desired, this is by far the most elegant
mode of dressing soles, as they look
much better than when fried whole. Instead
of rolling the fillets, they may be
cut into square pieces, and arranged in
the shape of a pyramid on the dish.
<i>Time.</i>—About 10 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per pair. <i>Sufficient</i>, 2
large soles for 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>SOLES, Fried.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 middling-sized soles,
hot lard or clarified dripping, egg, and
bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Skin and carefully
wash the soles, and cut off the fins,
wipe them very dry, and let them remain
in the cloth until it is time to dress them.
Have ready some fine bread-crumbs and
beaten egg; dredge the soles with a little
flour, brush them over with egg, and
cover with bread-crumbs. Put them in
a deep pan, with plenty of clarified dripping
or lard (when the expense is not objected
to, oil is still better) heated, so
that it may neither scorch the fish nor
make them sodden. When they are sufficiently
cooked on one side, turn them
carefully, and brown them on the other:
they may be considered ready when a
thick smoke rises. Lift them out carefully,
and lay them before the fire on a
reversed sieve and soft paper, to absorb
the fat. Particular attention should be
paid to this, as nothing is more disagreeable
than greasy fish: this may be always
avoided by dressing them in good time,
and allowing a few minutes for them to
get thoroughly crisp, and free from greasy
moisture. Dish them on a hot napkin,
garnish with cut lemon and fried parsley,
and send them to table with shrimp sauce
and plain melted butter. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes for large soles; less time for
small ones. <i>Average cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>
per pair. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>SOLES, with Mushrooms.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of milk, 1 pint of
water, 1 oz. butter, 1 oz. salt, a little
lemon-juice, 2 middling-sized soles.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse the soles, but do not
skin them, and lay them in a fish-kettle,
with the milk, water, butter, salt, and
lemon-juice. Bring them gradually to
boil, and let them simmer very gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
till done, which will be in about 7 minutes.
Take them up, drain them well on a cloth,
put them on a hot dish, and pour over
them a good mushroom sauce. (<i>See</i>
<a href="#SAUCES">Sauces</a>.) <i>Time.</i>—After the water boils,
7 minutes. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>SOLES, with Cream Sauce.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 soles; salt, cayenne,
and pounded mace to taste; the juice of
½ lemon, salt and water, ½ pint of cream.
<i>Mode.</i>—Skin, wash, and fillet the soles,
and divide each fillet in 2 pieces; lay
them in cold salt and water, which bring
gradually to a boil. When the water
boils, take out the fish, lay it in a delicately
clean stewpan, and cover with the
cream. Add the seasoning, simmer very
gently for ten minutes, and, just before
serving, put in the lemon-juice. The
fillets may be rolled, and secured by
means of a skewer; but this is not so
economical a way of dressing them, as
double the quantity of cream is required.
<i>Time.</i>—10 minutes in the cream. <i>Average
cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per pair. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>

<p>This will be found a most delicate
and delicious dish.</p>


<h3>SOUFFLÉ, to make.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 heaped tablespoonfuls
of potato-flour, rice-flour, arrowroot, or
tapioca, 1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, a piece of
butter the size of a walnut, sifted sugar
to taste, ¼ saltspoonful of salt flavouring.
<i>Mode.</i>—Mix the potato-flour, or whichever
one of the above ingredients is used,
with a little of the milk; put it into a
saucepan, with the remainder of the
milk, the butter, salt, and sufficient
pounded sugar to sweeten the whole
nicely. Stir these ingredients over the
fire until the mixture thickens; then
take it off the fire, and let it cool a little.
Separate the whites from the yolks of
the eggs, beat the
latter, and stir
them into the
soufflé batter. Now
whisk the whites of
the eggs to the
firmest possible
froth, for on this depends the excellence
of the dish; stir them to the other ingredients,
and add a few drops of essence
of any flavouring that may be preferred;
such as vanilla, lemon, orange, ginger,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Pour the batter into a soufflé-dish,
put it immediately into the oven,
and bake for about ½ hour; then take
it out, put the dish into another more
ornamental one, such as is made for the
purpose; hold a salamander or hot
shovel over the soufflé, strew it with
sifted sugar, and send it instantly to
table. The secret of making a soufflé
well, is to have the eggs well whisked,
but particularly the whites, the oven not
too hot, and to send it to table the
moment it comes from the oven. If the
soufflé be ever so well made, and it is
allowed to stand before being sent to
table, its appearance and goodness will
be entirely spoiled. Soufflés may be flavoured
in various ways, but must be
named accordingly. Vanilla is one of the
most delicate and recherché flavourings
that can be used for this very fashionable
dish. <i>Time.</i>—About ½ hour in the oven;
2 or 3 minutes to hold the salamander
over. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3
or 4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<h3>SOUPS, General Directions for
Making.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lean, juicy Beef, Mutton, and
Veal</span> form the basis of all good soups;
therefore it is advisable to procure those
pieces which afford the richest succulence,
and such as are fresh-killed.
Stale meat renders soups bad, and fat is
not well adapted for making them. The
principal art in composing good rich
soup is so to proportion the several
ingredients that the flavour of one shall
not predominate over another, and that
all the articles of which it is composed
shall form an agreeable whole. Care
must be taken that the roots and herbs
are perfectly well cleaned, and that the
water is proportioned to the quantity of
meat and other ingredients, allowing a
quart of water to a pound of meat for
soups, and half that quantity for gravies.
In making soups or gravies, gentle stewing
or simmering is absolutely necessary.
It may be remarked, moreover, that a
really good soup can never be made but
in a well-closed vessel, although, perhaps,
greater wholesomeness is obtained by an
occasional exposure to the air. Soups
will, in general, take from four to six
hours doing, and <i>are much better prepared
the day before they are wanted</i>. When
the soup is cold, the fat may be easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and completely removed; and in pouring
it off, care must be taken not to disturb
the settlings at the bottom of the vessel,
which are so fine that they will escape
through a sieve. A very fine hair-sieve
or cloth is the best strainer; and if the
soup is strained while it is hot, let the
tamis or cloth be previously soaked in
cold water. Clear soups must be perfectly
transparent, and thickened soups
about the consistency of cream. To
obtain a really clear and transparent
soup, it is requisite to continue skimming
the liquor until there is not a particle of
scum remaining, this being commenced
immediately after the water is added to
the meat. To thicken and give body to
soups and gravies, potato-mucilage,
arrowroot, bread-raspings, isinglass, flour
and butter, barley, rice, or oatmeal are
used. A piece of boiled beef pounded
to a pulp, with a bit of butter and flour,
and rubbed through a sieve, and gradually
incorporated with the soup, will be found
an excellent addition. When soups and
gravies are kept from day to day in hot
weather, they should be warmed up
every day, put into fresh-scalded pans
or tureens, and placed in a cool larder.
In temperate weather, every other day
may be sufficient. Stock made from
meat only keeps good longer than that
boiled with vegetables, the latter being
liable to turn the mixture sour, particularly
in very warm weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Various Herbs and Vegetables</span> are
required for the purpose of making soups
and gravies. Of these the principal are,—Scotch
barley, pearl barley, wheat flour,
oatmeal, bread-raspings, pease, beans,
rice, vermicelli, macaroni, isinglass, potato-mucilage,
mushroom or mushroom-ketchup,
champignons, parsnips, carrots,
beetroot, turnips, garlic, shalots, and
onions. Sliced onions, fried with butter
and flour till they are browned, and then
rubbed through a sieve, are excellent to
heighten the colour and flavour of brown
soups and sauces, and form the basis of
many of the fine relishes furnished by
the cook. The older and drier the onion,
the stronger will be its flavour. Leeks,
cucumber, or burnet vinegar; celery or
celery seed pounded. The latter, though
equally strong, does not impart the delicate
sweetness of the fresh vegetable;
and when used as a substitute, its flavour
should be corrected by the addition
of a bit of sugar. Cress-seed, parsley,
common thyme, lemon thyme, orange
thyme, knotted marjoram, sage,
mint, winter savoury, and basil. As
fresh green basil is seldom to be procured,
and its fine flavour is soon lost,
the best way of preserving the extract is
by pouring wine on the fresh leaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For the Seasoning of Soups</span>, bay-leaves,
tomato, tarragon, chervil, burnet,
allspice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg,
clove, mace, black and white pepper, essence
of anchovy, lemon peel and juice,
and Seville orange juice, are all taken.
The latter imparts a finer flavour than
the lemon, and the acid is much
milder. These materials, with wine,
mushroom ketchup, Harvey’s sauce,
tomato sauce, combined in various proportions,
are, with other ingredients,
manipulated into an almost endless variety
of excellent soups and gravies.
Soups, which are intended to constitute
the principal part of a meal, certainly
ought not to be flavoured like sauces,
which are only designed to give a relish
to some particular dish.</p>


<h3>SOUP-MAKING, the Chemistry
and Economy of.</h3>

<p>Stock being the basis of all meat
soups, and, also, of all the principal
sauces, it is essential to the success of
these culinary operations, to know the
most complete and economical method
of extracting, from a certain quantity
of meat, the best possible stock, or broth.
The theory and philosophy of this process
we will, therefore, explain, and then
proceed to show the practical course to
be adopted.</p>

<p>As all meat is principally composed of
fibres, fat, gelatine, osmazome, and
albumen, it is requisite to know that the
fibres are inseparable, constituting almost
all that remains of the meat after it has
undergone a long boiling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fat</span> is dissolved by boiling; but as it
is contained in cells covered by a very
fine membrane, which never dissolves,
a portion of it always adheres to the
fibres. The other portion rises to the
surface of the stock, and is that which
has escaped from the cells which were
not whole, or which have burst by boiling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gelatine</span> is soluble; it is the basis
and the nutritious portion of the stock.
When there is an abundance of it, it
causes the stock, when cold, to become
a jelly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Osmazome</span> is soluble even when cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and is that part of the meat which gives
flavour and perfume to the stock. The
flesh of old animals contains more <i>osmazome</i>
than that of young ones. Brown
meats contain more than white, and the
former make the stock more fragrant.
By roasting meat, the osmazome appears
to acquire higher properties; so, by
putting the remains of roast meats into
your stock-pot, you obtain a better
flavour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albumen</span> is of the nature of the white
of eggs; it can be dissolved in cold or
tepid water, but coagulates when it is
put into water not quite at the boiling-point.
From this property in albumen,
it is evident that if the meat is put into
the stock-pot when the water boils, or
after this is made to boil up quickly,
the albumen, in both cases, hardens. In
the first it rises to the surface, in the
second it remains in the meat, but in
both it prevents the gelatine and osmazome
from dissolving; and hence a thin
and tasteless stock will be obtained. It
ought to be known, too, that the coagulation
of the albumen in the meat
always takes place, more or less, according
to the size of the piece, as the parts
farthest from the surface always acquire
<i>that degree</i> of heat which congeals it
before entirely dissolving it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bones</span> ought always to form a component
part of the stock-pot. They are
composed of an earthy substance,—to
which they owe their solidity,—of gelatine,
and a fatty fluid, something like
marrow. <i>Two ounces</i> of them contain as
much gelatine as <i>one pound</i> of meat;
but in them, this is so incased in the
earthy substance, that boiling-water can
dissolve only the surface of whole bones.
By breaking them, however, you can
dissolve more, because you multiply their
surfaces; and by reducing them to powder
or paste, you can dissolve them
entirely; but you must not grind them
dry. We have said that gelatine forms
the basis of stock; but this, though very
nourishing, is entirely without taste;
and to make the stock savoury, it must
contain <i>osmazome</i>. Of this, bones do not
contain a particle; and that is the
reason why stock made entirely of them
is not liked; but when you add meat to
the broken or pulverized bones, the
osmazome contained in it makes the stock
sufficiently savoury.</p>

<p>In concluding this part of our subject,
the following condensed hints and directions
should be attended to in the
economy of soup-making:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beef makes the best Stock</span>; veal
stock has less colour and taste; whilst
mutton sometimes gives it a tallowy
smell, far from agreeable, unless the
meat has been previously roasted or
broiled. Fowls add very little to the
flavour of stock, unless they be old and
fat. Pigeons, when they are old, add
the most flavour to it; and a rabbit or
partridge is also a great improvement.
From the freshest meat the best stock is
obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If the Meat be Boiled</span> solely to
make stock, it must be cut up into the
smallest possible pieces; but, generally
speaking, if it is desired to have good
stock and a piece of savoury meat as
well, it is necessary to put a rather
large piece into the stock-pot, say sufficient
for two or three days, during which
time the stock will keep well in all
weathers. Choose the freshest meat,
and have it cut as thick as possible; for
if it is a thin, flat piece, it will not look
well, and will be very soon spoiled by the
boiling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Never wash Meat</span>, as it deprives its
surface of all its juices; separate it from
the bones, and tie it round with tape, so
that its shape may be preserved, then
put it into the stock-pot, and for each
pound of meat, let there be one pint of
water; press it down with the hand, to
allow the air, which it contains, to
escape, and which often raises it to the
top of the water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Put the Stock-pot on a Gentle
Fire</span>, so that it may heat gradually. The
albumen will first dissolve, afterwards
coagulate; and as it is in this state lighter
than the liquid, it will rise to the surface,
bringing with it all its impurities.
It is this which makes <i>the scum</i>. The
rising of the hardened albumen has the
same effect in clarifying stock as the
white of eggs; and, as a rule, it may be
said that the more scum there is, the
clearer will be the stock. Always take
care that the fire is very regular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remove the Scum</span> when it rises
thickly, and do not let the stock boil,
because then one portion of the scum
will be dissolved, and the other go to the
bottom of the pot; thus rendering it
very difficult to obtain a clear broth.
If the fire is regular, it will not be necessary
to add cold water in order to
make the scum rise; but if the fire is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
large at first, it will then be necessary
to do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When the Stock is well Skimmed</span>,
and begins to boil, put in salt and vegetables,
which to every 3 lbs. of meat
should consist of three carrots, two
turnips, one parsnip, a few leeks, and a
little celery. You can add, according to
taste, a piece of cabbage, two or three
cloves stuck in an onion, and a tomato.
The latter gives a very agreeable flavour
to the stock. If burnt onion be added, it
ought, according to the advice of a famous
French <i>chef</i>, to be tied in a little bag:
without this precaution, the colour of
the stock is liable to be clouded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By this time</span> we will now suppose
that you have chopped the bones which
were separated from the meat, and those
which were left from the roast meat of
the day before. Remember, as was
before pointed out, that the more these
are broken, the more gelatine you will
have. The best way to break them up
is to pound them roughly in an iron
mortar, adding, from time to time, a
little water, to prevent them getting
heated. It is a great saving thus to
make use of the bones of meat, which,
in too many English families, we fear,
are entirely wasted; for it is certain, as
previously stated, that two ounces of
bone contain as much gelatine (which is
the nutritive portion of stock) as one
pound of meat. In their broken state
tie them up in a bag, and put them in
the stock-pot; adding the gristly parts
of cold meat, and trimmings, which can
be used for no other purpose. If, to
make up the weight, you have received
from the butcher a piece of mutton or
veal, broil it slightly over a clear fire
before putting it in the stock-pot, and be
very careful that it does not contract the
least taste of being smoked or burnt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Add now the Vegetables</span>, which, to
a certain extent, will stop the boiling of
the stock. Wait, therefore, till it
simmers well up again, then draw it to
the side of the fire, and keep it gently
simmering till it is served, preserving, as
before said, your fire always the same.
Cover the stock-pot well, to prevent
evaporation; do not fill it up, even if you
take out a little stock, unless the meat is
exposed; in which case a little boiling water
may be added, but only enough to
cover it. After six hours’ slow and
gentle simmering, the stock is done;
and it should not be continued on the
fire longer than is necessary, or it will
tend to insipidity.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—It is on a good stock, or first
good broth and sauce, that excellence in
cookery depends. If the preparation
of this basis of the culinary art is intrusted
to negligent or ignorant persons,
and the stock is not well skimmed, but
indifferent results will be obtained.
The stock will never be clear; and when
it is obliged to be clarified, it is deteriorated
both in quality and flavour. In
the proper management of the stock-pot
an immense deal of trouble is saved,
inasmuch as one stock, in a small dinner,
serves for all purposes. Above all
things, the greatest economy, consistent
with excellence, should be practised,
and the price of everything which enters
the kitchen correctly ascertained. The
<i>theory</i> of this part of Household Management
may appear trifling, but its practice
is extensive, and therefore it requires
the best attention.</p>

<h3>SOUP, à la Solferino (Sardinian
Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 eggs, ½ pint of cream,
2 oz. of fresh butter, salt and pepper to
taste, a little flour to thicken, 2 quarts
of bouillon. <i>Mode.</i>—Beat the eggs, put
them into a stewpan, and add the cream,
butter, and seasoning; stir in as much
flour as will bring it to the consistency
of dough; make it into balls, either
round or egg-shaped, and fry them in
butter; put them in the tureen, and pour
the boiling bouillon over them. <i>Time.</i>—1
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per quart.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8
persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—This recipe was communicated
to the Editress by an English gentleman,
who was present at the battle of Solferino,
on June 24, 1859, and who was
requested by some of Victor Emmanuel’s
troops, on the day before the battle,
to partake of a portion of their <i>potage.</i>
He willingly enough consented, and
found that these clever campaigners had
made a palatable dish from very easily-procured
materials. In sending the
recipe for insertion in this work, he has,
however, Anglicised, and somewhat, he
thinks, improved it.</p>

<h3>SPINACH, to Boil (English Mode).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 pailfuls of spinach, 2
heaped tablespoonfuls of salt, 1 oz. of
of butter, pepper to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick
the spinach carefully, and see that no
stalks or weeds are left amongst it;
wash it in several waters, and, to prevent
it being gritty, act in the following
manner:—Have ready two large pans or
tubs filled with water; put the spinach
into one of these, and thoroughly wash it;
then, <i>with the hands</i>, take out the spinach,
and put it into the <i>other tub</i> of
water (by this means all the grit will be
left at the-bottom of the tub); wash
it again, and
should it not
be perfectly
free from dirt,
repeat the process.
Put it
into a very large saucepan, with about
½ pint of water, just sufficient to keep
the spinach from burning, and the above
proportion of salt. Press it down frequently
with a wooden spoon, that it
may be done equally; and when it has
boiled for rather more than 10 minutes,
or until it is perfectly tender, drain it in
a colander, squeeze it quite dry, and chop
it finely. Put the spinach into a clean
stewpan, with the butter and a seasoning
of pepper; stir the whole over the fire
until quite hot; then put it on a hot dish,
and garnish with sippets of toasted bread.
<i>Time.</i>—10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach,
5 minutes to warm with the butter.
<i>Average cost</i> for the above quantity, 8<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Spring
spinach from March to July;
winter spinach from November to March.</p>

<div class="caption">SPINACH GARNISHED WITH
CROÛTONS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Grated nutmeg, pounded mace,
or lemon-juice may also be added to
enrich the flavour; and poached eggs are
also frequently served with spinach: they
should be placed on the top of it, and
it should be garnished with sippets of
toasted bread.</p>


<h3>SPINACH dressed with Cream, à
la Française.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 pailfuls of spinach, 2
tablespoonfuls of salt, 2 oz. of butter, 8
tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 small teaspoonful
of pounded sugar, a very little
grated nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil and drain
the spinach; chop it fine, and put it into
a stewpan with the butter; stir it over
a gentle fire, and, when the butter has
dried away, add the remaining ingredients,
and simmer for about 5 minutes.
Previously to pouring in the cream, boil it
first, in case it should curdle. Serve on
a hot dish, and garnish either with
sippets of toasted bread or leaves of puff-paste.

to July; winter spinach from November
to March.</p>


<h3>SPINACH, French Mode of Dressing.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 pailfuls of spinach,
2 tablespoonfuls of salt, 2 oz. of butter,
1 teaspoonful of flour, 8 tablespoonfuls
of good gravy; when liked, a very little
grated nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick, wash,
and boil the spinach, and when tender,
drain and squeeze it perfectly dry from
the water that hangs about it. Chop it
very fine, put the butter into a stewpan,
and lay the spinach over that; stir it
over a gentle fire, and dredge in the
flour. Add the gravy, and let it boil
<i>quickly</i> for a few minutes, that it may
not discolour. When the flavour of nutmeg
is liked, grate some to the spinach,
and when thoroughly hot, and the gravy
has dried away a little, serve. Garnish
the dish with sippets of toasted bread.
<i>Time.</i>—10 to 15 minutes to boil the
spinach; 10 minutes to simmer in the
gravy. <i>Average cost</i> for the above quantity,
8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Spring spinach from March
to July; winter spinach from October to
February.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—For an <i>entremets</i> or second-course
dish, spinach dressed by the above
recipe may be pressed into a hot mould;
it should then be turned out quickly, and
served immediately.</p>


<h3>SPINACH-GREEN, for Colouring
various Dishes.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 handfuls of spinach.
<i>Mode.</i>—Pick and wash the spinach free
from dirt, and pound the leaves in a
mortar to extract the juice; then press
it through a hair sieve, and put the juice
into a small stewpan or jar. Place this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
in a bain marie, or saucepan of boiling
water, and let it set. Watch it closely,
as it should not boil; and, as soon as it
is done, lay it in a sieve, so that all the
water may drain from it, and the green
will then be ready for colouring. If
made according to this recipe, the
spinach-green will be found far superior
to that boiled in the ordinary way.</p>


<h3>SPINACH SOUP (French Recipe).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—As much spinach as,
when boiled, will half fill a vegetable-dish,
2 quarts of very clear medium stock.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make the cooked spinach into
balls the size of an egg, and slip them
into the soup-tureen. This is a very
elegant soup, the green of the spinach
forming a pretty contrast to the brown
gravy. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>s.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i> from October
to June.</p>


<h3>SPONGE-CAKE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The weight of 8 eggs in
pounded loaf sugar, the weight of 5 in
flour, the rind of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoonful
of brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the eggs into
one side of the scale, and take the weight
of 8 in pounded loaf sugar, and the
weight of 5 in good <i>dry</i> flour. Separate
the yolks from the whites of the eggs;
beat the former, put them into a saucepan
with the sugar, and let them remain
over the fire until <i>milk-warm</i>, keeping
them well stirred. Then put them into
a basin, add the grated lemon-rind
mixed with the brandy, and stir these
well together, dredging in the flour
very gradually.
Whisk the
whites of the
eggs to a very
stiff froth, stir
them to the
flour, &amp;c., and
beat the cake
well for ¼ hour.
Put it into a buttered mould strewn with
a little fine-sifted sugar, and bake the
cake in a quick oven for 1½ hour. Care
must be taken that it is put into the
oven immediately, or it will not be light.
The flavouring of this cake may he varied
by adding a few drops of essence of almonds
instead of the grated lemon-rind.
<i>Time.</i>—1½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 1 cake. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>

<h3>SPONGE-CAKE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of loaf sugar, not
quite ¼ pint of water, 5 eggs, 1 lemon, ½
lb. of flour, ¼ teaspoonful of carbonate of
soda. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the sugar and water
together until they form a thick syrup;
let it cool a little, then pour it to the
eggs, which should be previously well
whisked; and after the eggs and syrup
are mixed together, continue beating
them for a few minutes. Grate the
lemon-rind, mix the carbonate of soda
with the flour, and stir these lightly to
the other ingredients; then add the
lemon-juice, and, when the whole is
thoroughly mixed, pour it into a buttered
mould, and bake in rather a quick oven
for rather more than 1 hour. The remains
of sponge or Savoy cakes answer
very well for trifles, light puddings, &amp;c.;
and a very stale one (if not mouldy)
makes an excellent tipsy cake. <i>Time.</i>—Rather
more than 1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to make 1 cake. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>SPONGE-CAKES, Small.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The weight of 5 eggs in
flour, the weight of 8 in pounded loaf
sugar; flavouring to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Let
the flour be perfectly dry, and the sugar
well pounded and sifted. Separate the
whites from the yolks of the eggs, and
beat the latter up with the sugar; then
whisk the whites until they become
rather stiff, and mix them with the yolks,
but do not stir them more than is just
necessary to mingle the ingredients well
together. Dredge in the flour by degrees,
add the flavouring; butter the
tins well, pour in the batter, sift a little
sugar over the cakes, and bake them in
rather a quick oven, but do not allow
them to take too much colour, as they
should be rather pale. Remove them
from the tins before they get cold, and
turn them on their faces, where let them
remain until quite cold, when store them
away in a closed tin canister or wide-mouthed
glass bottle. <i>Time.</i>—10 to 15
minutes in a quick oven. <i>Average cost</i>,
1<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>SPRATS.</h3>

<p>Sprats should be cooked very fresh,
which can be ascertained by their bright
and sparkling eyes. Wipe them dry;
fasten them in rows by a skewer run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
through the eyes; dredge with flour, and
broil them on a gridiron over a nice clear
fire. The gridiron should be rubbed
with suet. Serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—3
or 4 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> per lb.
<i>Seasonable</i> from November to March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Choose Sprats.</span>—Choose these
from their silvery appearance, as the
brighter they are, so are they the
fresher.</p>


<h3>SPRATS, Dried.</h3>

<p>Dried sprats should be put into a
basin, and boiling water poured over
them; they may then be skinned and
served, and this will be found a much
better way than boiling them.</p>


<h3>SPRATS, Fried in Batter.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 eggs, flour, bread-crumbs;
seasoning of salt and pepper to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Wipe the sprats, and
dip them in a batter made of the above
ingredients. Fry of a nice brown, serve
very hot, and garnish with fried parsley.
Sprats may be baked like herrings.</p>


<h3>SPROUTS, to Boil Young.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To each ½ gallon of water
allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; a
<i>very small</i> piece of soda. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick
away all the dead leaves, and wash the
greens well in cold water; drain them in
a colander, and put them into fast-boiling
water, with salt and soda in the above
proportion. Keep them boiling quickly,
with the lid uncovered, until tender; and
the moment they are done, take them
up, or their colour will be spoiled; when
well drained, serve. The great art in
cooking greens properly, and to have
them a good colour, is to put them into
<i>plenty of fast-boiling</i> water, to let them
boil very quickly, and to take them up
the moment they become tender. <i>Time.</i>—Brocoli
sprouts, 10 to 12 minutes;
young greens, 10 to 12 minutes; sprouts,
12 minutes, after the water boils. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Sprouts
of various kinds may
be had all the year.</p>


<h3>STEW, Irish.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 lbs. of the loin or neck
of mutton, 5 lbs. of potatoes, 5 large
onions, pepper and salt to taste, rather
more than 1 pint of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Trim
off some of the fat of the above
quantity of loin or neck of mutton, and
cut it into chops of a moderate thickness.
Pare and halve the potatoes, and cut the
onions into thick slices. Put a layer of
potatoes at the bottom of a stewpan,
then a layer of mutton and onions, and
season with pepper and salt; proceed in
this manner until the stewpan is full,
taking care to have plenty of vegetables
at the top. Pour in the water, and let it
stew very gently for 2½ hours, keeping
the lid of the stewpan closely shut the
<i>whole</i> time, and occasionally shaking the
preparation to prevent its burning. <i>Time.</i>—2½
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, for this quantity,
2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Suitable for a winter dish.</p>


<h3>STEW, Irish.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 or 3 lbs. of the breast
of mutton, 1½ pint of water, salt and
pepper to taste, 4 lbs. of potatoes, 4 large
onions. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the mutton into a
stewpan with the water and a little salt,
and let it stew gently for an hour; cut
the meat into small pieces, skim the fat
from the gravy, and pare and slice the
potatoes and onions. Put all the ingredients
into the stewpan, in layers, first a
layer of vegetables, then one of meat,
and sprinkle seasoning of pepper and
salt between each layer; cover closely,
and let the whole stew very gently for
1 hour, or rather more, shaking it frequently
to prevent its burning. <i>Time.</i>—Rather
more than 2 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—Suitable for a winter dish.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Irish stew may be prepared in
the same manner as above, but baked in
a jar instead of boiled. About 2 hours
or rather more in a moderate oven will
be sufficient time to bake it.</p>


<h3>STILTON CHEESE.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/illus-329.jpg" width="252" height="183" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">STILTON CHEESE.</div>
</div>

<p>Stilton cheese, or British Parmesan, as
it is sometimes called, is generally preferred
to all other cheeses by those whose
authority
few will dispute.
Those
made in
May or June
are usually
served at
Christmas;
or, to be in
prime order,
should be
kept from
10 to 12 months, or even longer. An
artificial ripeness in Stilton cheese is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
sometimes produced by inserting a small
piece of decayed Cheshire into an aperture
at the top. From 3 weeks to a
month is sufficient time to ripen the
cheese. An additional flavour may also
be obtained by scooping out a piece from
the top, and pouring therein port, sherry,
Madeira, or old ale, and letting the
cheese absorb these for two or three
weeks. But that cheese is the finest
which is ripened without any artificial
aid, is the opinion of those who are
judges in these matters. In serving a
Stilton cheese, the top of it should be cut
off to form a lid, and a napkin or piece of
white paper, with a frill at the top,
pinned round. When the cheese goes
from table, the lid should be replaced.</p>


<h3><a id="STOCKS"></a>STOCKS for all kinds of Soups
(Rich Strong Stock).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 lbs. of shin of beef,
4 lbs. of knuckle of veal, ¼ lb. of good lean
ham; any poultry trimmings; 2 oz. of
butter; 3 onions, 3 carrots, 2 turnips (the
latter should be omitted in summer, lest
they ferment), 1 head of celery, a few
chopped mushrooms, when obtainable;
1 tomato, a bunch of savoury herbs, not
forgetting parsley; 1½ oz. of salt, 3 lumps
of sugar, 12 white peppercorns, 6 cloves,
3 small blades of mace, 4 quarts of water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Line a delicately clean stewpan
with the ham cut in thin broad slices,
carefully trimming off all its rusty fat;
cut up the beef and veal in pieces about
3 inches square, and lay them on the
ham; set it on the stove, and draw it
down, and stir frequently. When the
meat is equally browned, put in the beef
and veal bones, the poultry trimmings,
and pour in the cold water. Skim well,
and occasionally add a little cold water,
to stop its boiling, until it becomes quite
clear; then put in all the other ingredients,
and simmer very slowly for 5 hours.
Do not let it come to a brisk boil, that
the stock be not wasted, and that its
colour may be preserved. Strain through
a very fine hair sieve, or cloth, and the
stock will be fit for use. <i>Time.</i>—5
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per quart.</p>


<h3>STOCK, Economical.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The liquor in which a
joint of meat has been boiled, say
4 quarts; trimmings of fresh meat or
poultry, shank-bones, &amp;c., roast-beef
bones, any pieces the larder may furnish;
vegetables, spices, and the same
seasoning as in the foregoing recipe.
<i>Mode.</i>—Let all the ingredients simmer
gently for 6 hours, taking care to skim
carefully at first. Strain it off, and put
by for use. <i>Time.</i>—6 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 3<i>d.</i> per quart.</p>


<h3>STOCK, Medium.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 lbs. of shin of beef, or
4 lbs. of knuckle of veal, or 2 lbs. of
each; any bones, trimmings of poultry,
or fresh meat, ¼ lb. of lean bacon or
ham, 2 oz. of butter, 2 large onions, each
stuck with 3 cloves; 1 turnip, 3 carrots,
1 head of celery, 3 lumps of sugar, 2 oz.
of salt, ½ a teaspoonful of whole pepper,
1 large blade of mace, 1 bunch of savoury
herbs, 4 quarts and ½ pint of cold water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut up the meat and bacon or
ham into pieces of about 3 inches square;
rub the butter on the bottom of the
stewpan; put in ½ a pint of water, the
meat, and all the other ingredients.
Cover the stewpan, and place it on a
sharp fire, occasionally stirring its contents.
When the bottom of the pan becomes
covered with a pale, jelly-like
substance, add the 4 quarts of cold water,
and simmer very gently for 5 hours.
As we have said before, do not let it boil
quickly. Remove every particle of scum
whilst it is doing, and strain it through
a fine hair sieve. This stock is the basis
of most of the soups mentioned in this
dictionary, and will be found quite strong
enough for ordinary purposes. <i>Time.</i>—5½
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per quart.</p>


<h3>STOCK, To Clarify.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The whites of 2 eggs,
½ pint of water, 2 quarts of stock.
<i>Mode.</i>—Supposing that by some accident
the soup is not quite clear, and that its
quantity is 2 quarts, take the whites of
2 eggs, carefully separated from their
yolks, whisk them well together with
the water, and add gradually the 2 quarts
of boiling stock, still whisking. Place
the soup on the fire, and when boiling
and well skimmed, whisk the eggs with
it till nearly boiling again; then draw
it from the fire, and let it settle, until
the whites of the eggs become separated.
Pass through a fine cloth, and the soup
should be clear.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The rule is, that all clear soups
should be of a light straw-colour, and
should not savour too strongly of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
meat; and that all white or brown thick
soups should have no more consistency
than will enable them to adhere slightly
to the spoon when hot. All <i>purées</i>
should be somewhat thicker.</p>


<h3>STOCK, White (to be used in the
preparation of White Soups).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 lbs. of knuckle of veal,
any poultry trimmings, 4 slices of lean
ham, 3 carrots, 2 onions, 1 head of celery,
12 white peppercorns, 2 oz. of salt,
1 blade of mace, a bunch of herbs, 1 oz.
butter, 4 quarts of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
up the veal, and put it with the bones
and trimmings of poultry, and the ham,
into the stewpan, which has been rubbed
with the butter. Moisten with ½ a pint
of water, and simmer till the gravy begins
to flow. Then add the 4 quarts of
water and the remainder of the ingredients;
simmer for 5 hours. After skimming
and straining it carefully through
a very fine hair sieve, it will be ready
for use. <i>Time.</i>—5½ hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
9<i>d.</i> per quart.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When stronger stock is desired,
double the quantity of veal, or put
in an old fowl. The liquor in which a
young turkey has been boiled, is an
excellent addition to all white stock or
soups.</p>


<h3>STOCK, Consommé or White, for
many Sauces.</h3>

<p>Consommé is made precisely in the
same manner as white stock, and, for
ordinary purposes, will be found quite
good enough. When, however, a stronger
stock is desired, either put in half the
quantity of water, or double that of the
meat. This is a very good foundation
for all white sauces.</p>


<h3>STRAWBERRY JAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit
allow ½ pint of red-currant juice, 1¼ lb.
of loaf sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Strip the currants
from the stalks, put them into a
jar; place this jar in a saucepan of boiling
water, and simmer until the juice
is well drawn from the fruit; strain the
currants, measure the juice, put it into
a preserving pan, and add the sugar.
Select well-ripened but sound strawberries;
pick them from the stalks, and
when the sugar is dissolved in the currant-juice,
put in the fruit. Simmer the
whole over a moderate fire, from ½ to ¾
hour, carefully removing the scum as it
rises. Stir the jam only enough to prevent
it from burning at the bottom of
the pan, as the fruit should be preserved
as whole as possible. Put the
jam into jars, and when cold, cover
down. <i>Time.</i>—½ to ¾ hour, reckoning
from the time the jam simmers all over.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 7<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per lb. pot.
<i>Sufficient.</i>—12 pints of strawberries will
make 12 lbs. of jam. <i>Seasonable</i> in June
and July.</p>


<h3>STRAWBERRY JELLY.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Strawberries, pounded
sugar; to every pint of juice allow 1¼ oz.
of isinglass. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick the strawberries,
put them into a pan, squeeze
them well with a wooden spoon, add
sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten them
nicely, and let them remain for 1 hour,
that the juice may be extracted; then
add ½ pint of water to every pint of
juice. Strain the strawberry-juice and
water through a bag; measure it, and
to every pint allow 1¼ oz. of isinglass,
melted and clarified in ¼ pint of water.
Mix this with the juice; put the jelly
into a mould, and set the mould in ice.
A little lemon-juice added to the strawberry-juice
improves the flavour of the
jelly, if the fruit is very ripe; but it
must be well strained before it is put
to the other ingredients, or it will make
the jelly muddy. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour to
draw the juice. <i>Average cost</i>, with the
best isinglass, 3<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow
1½ pint of jelly for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in June, July, and August.</p>


<h3>STRAWBERRIES and CREAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every pint of picked
strawberries allow 1/3 pint of cream, 2 oz.
of finely-pounded sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Pick
the stalks from the fruit, place it on
a glass dish, sprinkle over it pounded
sugar, and slightly stir the strawberries,
that they may all be equally sweetened;
pour the cream over the top, and serve.
Devonshire cream, when it can be obtained,
is exceedingly delicious for this
dish; and, if very thick indeed, may
be diluted with a little thin cream or
milk. <i>Average cost</i> for this quantity,
with cream at 1<i>s.</i> per pint, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 2 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> in June
and July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>


<h3>STRAWBERRIES, Preserved in
Wine.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every quart bottle
allow ¼ lb. of finely-pounded loaf sugar;
sherry or Madeira. <i>Mode.</i>—Let the fruit
be gathered in fine weather, and used as
soon as picked. Have ready some perfectly
dry glass bottles, and some nice
soft corks or bungs. Pick the stalks
from the strawberries, drop them into
the bottles, sprinkling amongst them
pounded sugar in the above proportion,
and when the fruit reaches to the neck of
the bottle, fill up with sherry or Madeira.
Cork the bottles down with new corks,
and dip them into melted resin. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in June or July.</p>


<h3>STRAWBERRIES, to Preserve
Whole.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of fruit
allow 1½ lb. of good loaf sugar, 1 pint of
red-currant juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose the
strawberries not too ripe, of a fine large
sort and of a good colour. Pick off the
stalks, lay the strawberries in a dish,
and sprinkle over them half the quantity
of sugar, which must be finely pounded.
Shake the dish gently, that the sugar
may be equally distributed and touch
the under-side of the fruit, and let it
remain for 1 day. Then have ready the
currant-juice, drawn as for red-currant
jelly; boil it with the remainder of the
sugar until it forms a thin syrup, and
in this simmer the strawberries and
sugar, until the whole is sufficiently
jellied. Great care must be taken not to
stir the fruit roughly, as it should be
preserved as whole as possible. Strawberries
prepared in this manner are very
good served in glasses and mixed with
thin cream. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour to 20 minutes
to simmer the strawberries in the
syrup. <i>Seasonable</i> in June and July.</p>

<div class="caption">OPEN TART.</div>
</div>

<h3>STRAWBERRY, Open Tart of, or
any other Kind of Preserve.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Trimmings of puff-paste,
any kind of jam. <i>Mode.</i>—Butter a tart-pan
of the shape shown in the engraving,
roll out the paste to the thickness of ½
an inch, and line the pan with it; prick
a few holes at the bottom with a fork,
and bake the tart in a brisk oven from
10 to 15 minutes. Let the paste cool a
little; then fill it with preserve, place a
few stars or leaves on it, which have
been previously cut out of the paste and
baked, and the tart is ready for table.
By making it in this manner, both the
flavour and colour of the jam are preserved,
which would otherwise be lost,
were it baked in the oven on the paste;
and, besides, so much jam is not required.
<i>Time.</i>—10 to 15 min. <i>Average
cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient.</i>—1 tart for 3 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<h3>STURGEON, Baked.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 small sturgeon, salt
and pepper to taste, 1 small bunch of
herbs, the juice of ½ lemon, ¼ lb. of
butter, 1 pint of white wine. <i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse
the fish thoroughly, skin it, and
split it along the belly without separating
it; have ready a large baking-dish, in
which lay the fish, sprinkle over the
seasoning and herbs very finely minced,
and moisten it with the lemon-juice and
wine. Place the butter in small pieces
over the whole of the fish, put it in the
oven, and baste frequently; brown it
nicely, and serve with its own gravy.
<i>Time.</i>—Nearly 1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i>
to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> from August
to March.</p>


<h3>STURGEON, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Veal stuffing, buttered
paper, the tail-end of a sturgeon. <i>Mode.</i>—Cleanse
the fish, bone and skin it;
make a nice veal stuffing (<i>see</i> <a href="#FORCEMEATS">Forcemeats</a>),
and fill it with the part where the bones
came from; roll it in buttered paper,
bind it up firmly with tape, like a fillet
of veal, and roast it in a Dutch oven
before a clear fire. Serve with good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
brown gravy, or plain melted butter.
<i>Time.</i>—About 1 hour. <i>Average costs</i>,
1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to March.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Sturgeon maybe plainly boiled,
and served with Dutch sauce. The fish
is very firm, and requires long boiling.</p>


<h3>SUET PUDDING, to serve with
Roast Meat.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of
finely-chopped suet, ½ saltspoonful of
salt, ½ saltspoonful of pepper, ½ pint of
milk or water. <i>Mode.</i>—Chop the suet
very finely, after freeing it from skin,
and mix it well with the flour; add the
salt and pepper (this latter ingredient
may be omitted if the flavour is not liked),
and make the whole into a smooth paste
with the above proportion of milk or
water. Tie the pudding in a floured
cloth, or put it into a buttered basin,
and boil from 2½ to 3 hours. To enrich
it, substitute 3 beaten eggs for some of
the milk or water, and increase the proportion
of suet. <i>Time.</i>—2½ to 3 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When there is a joint roasting
or baking, this pudding may be boiled in
a long shape, and then cut into slices a
few minutes before dinner is served;
these slices should be laid in the dripping-pan
for a minute or two, and then
browned before the fire. Most children
like this accompaniment to roast-meat.</p>


<h3>SUGAR, to Boil, to Caramel.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every lb. of lump
sugar allow 1 gill of spring water. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the sugar and water together very
quickly over a clear fire, skimming it
very carefully as soon as it boils. Keep
it boiling until the sugar snaps when a
little of it is dropped in a pan of cold
water. If it remains hard, the sugar has
attained the right degree; then squeeze
in a little lemon-juice, and let it remain
an instant on the fire. Set the pan into
another of cold water, and the caramel
is then ready for use. The insides of
well-oiled moulds are often ornamented
with this sugar, which with a fork should
be spread over them in fine threads or
network. A dish of light pastry, tastefully
arranged, looks very pretty with
this sugar spun lightly over it.</p>


<h3>SUPPERS.</h3>

<p>Much may be done in the arrangement
of a supper-table, at a very small
expense, provided <i>taste</i> and <i>ingenuity</i> are
exercised. The colours and flavours of
the various dishes should contrast nicely;
there should be plenty of fruit and
flowers on the table, and the room should
be well lighted. We have endeavoured
to show how the various dishes may be
placed; but of course these little matters
entirely depend on the length and width
of the table used, on individual taste,
whether the tables are arranged round
the room, whether down the centre,
with a cross one at the top, or whether
the supper is laid in two separate rooms,
&amp;c., &amp;c. The garnishing of the dishes
has also much to do with the appearance
of a supper-table. Hams and tongues
should be ornamented with cut vegetable
flowers, raised pies with aspic jelly cut
in dice, and all the dishes garnished
sufficiently to be in good taste without
looking absurd. The eye, in fact, should
be as much gratified as the palate. Hot
soup is now often served at suppers, but
is not placed on the table. The servants
fill the plates from a tureen on the buffet,
and then hand them to the guests: when
these plates are removed, the business of
supper commences.</p>

<p>Where small rooms and large parties
necessitate having a standing supper,
many things enumerated in the following
bill of fare may be placed on the buffet.
Dishes for these suppers should be selected
which may be eaten standing
without any trouble. The following list
may, perhaps, assist our readers in the
arrangement of a buffet for a standing
supper.</p>

<p>Beef, ham, and tongue-sandwiches,
lobster and oyster-patties, sausage-rolls,
meat-rolls, lobster-salad, dishes of fowls,
the latter <i>all cut up</i>; dishes of sliced
ham, sliced tongue, sliced beef, and galantine
of veal; various jellies, blancmanges,
and creams; custards in glasses,
compôtes of fruit, tartlets of jam, and
several dishes of small fancy pastry;
dishes of fresh fruit, bon-bons, sweetmeats,
two or three sponge-cakes, a few
plates of biscuits, and the buffet ornamented
with vases of fresh or artificial
flowers. The above dishes are quite sufficient
for a standing supper; where
more are desired, a supper must then be
laid and arranged in the usual manner.</p>

<h3>SWEETBREADS, Baked (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 sweetbreads, egg and
bread-crumbs, oiled butter, 3 slices of
toast, brown gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose
large white sweetbreads; put them into
warm water to draw out the blood, and
to improve their colour; let them remain
for rather more than 1 hour; then put
them into boiling water, and allow them
to simmer for about 10 minutes, which
renders them firm. Take them up, drain
them, brush over with egg, sprinkle with
bread-crumbs; dip them in egg again,
and then into more bread-crumbs. Drop
on them a little oiled butter, and put the
sweetbreads into a moderately-heated
oven, and let them bake for nearly ¾
hour. Make 3 pieces of toast; place the
sweetbreads on the toast, and pour round,
but not over them, a good brown gravy.
<i>Time.</i>—To soak 1 hour, to be boiled 10
minutes, baked 40 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for an entrée.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—In full season from May to
August.</p>

<h3>SWEETBREADS, Fried (à la
Maître d’Hôtel), an Entrée.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 sweetbreads, egg and
bread-crumbs, ¼ lb. of butter, salt and
pepper to taste, rather more than ½ pint
of maître-d’hôtel sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Soak
the sweetbreads in warm water for an
hour; then boil them for 10 minutes;
cut them in slices, egg and bread-crumb
them, season with pepper and salt, and
put them into a frying-pan, with the
above proportion of butter. Keep turning
them until done, which will be in
about 10 minutes; dish them, and pour
over them a maître-d’hôtel sauce. The
dish may be garnished with slices of cut
lemon. <i>Time.</i>—To soak 1 hour, to be
boiled 10 minutes, to be fried about 10
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>, according
to the season. <i>Sufficient</i> for an
entrée. <i>Seasonable.</i>—In full season from
May to August.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The egg and bread-crumb may
be omitted, and the slices of sweetbread
dredged with a little flour instead, and a
good gravy may be substituted for the
maître-d’hôtel sauce. This is a very
simple method of dressing them.</p>


<h3>SWEETBREADS, Stewed (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 sweetbreads, 1 pint of
white stock, thickening of butter and
flour, 6 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 tablespoonful
of lemon-juice, 1 blade of
pounded mace, white pepper and salt to
taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Soak the sweetbreads in
warm water for 1 hour, and boil them for
10 minutes; take them out, put them
into cold water for a few minutes; lay
them in a stewpan with the stock, and
simmer them gently for rather more than
½ hour. Dish them; thicken the gravy
with a little butter and flour; let it boil
up, add the remaining ingredients, allow
the sauce to get quite <i>hot</i>, but <i>not boil</i>,
and pour it over the sweetbreads. <i>Time.</i>—To
soak 1 hour, to be boiled 10 minutes,
stewed rather more than ½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 1<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>, according
to the season. <i>Sufficient</i> for an entrée.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—In full season from May to
August.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A few mushrooms added to this
dish, and stewed with the sweetbreads,
will be found an improvement.</p>


<h3>SWEETBREADS, Lambs’, larded,
and Asparagus (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 or 3 sweetbreads, ½
pint of veal stock, white pepper and salt
to taste, a small bunch of green onions,
1 blade of pounded mace, thickening of
butter and flour, 2 eggs, nearly ½ pint of
cream, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley,
a very little grated nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Soak
the sweetbreads in lukewarm water,
and put them into a saucepan with sufficient
boiling water to cover them, and
let them simmer for 10 minutes; then
take them out and put them into cold
water. Now lard them, lay them in a
stewpan, add the stock, seasoning, onions,
mace, and a thickening of butter and
flour, and stew gently for ¼ hour or 20
minutes. Beat up the egg with the
cream, to which add the minced parsley
and a very little grated nutmeg. Put
this to the other ingredients; stir it well
till quite hot, but do not let it boil after
the cream is added, or it will curdle.
Have ready some asparagus-tops, boiled;
add these to the sweetbreads, and serve.

<h3>SWEETBREADS, another Way
to Dress (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Sweetbreads, egg and
bread-crumbs, ½ pint of gravy, ½ glass of
sherry. <i>Mode.</i>—Soak the sweetbreads in
water for an hour, and throw them into
boiling water to render them firm. Let
them stew gently for about ¼ hour, take
them out and put them into a cloth to
drain all the water from them. Brush
them over with egg, sprinkle them with
bread-crumbs, and either brown them in
the oven or before the fire. Have ready
the above quantity of gravy, to which
add ½ glass of sherry; dish the sweetbreads,
pour the gravy under them, and
garnish with water-cresses. <i>Time.</i>—Rather
more than ½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i>—3
sweetbreads for 1 entrée. <i>Seasonable</i>,
from Easter to Michaelmas.</p>


<h3>SYLLABUB.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of sherry or white
wine, ½ grated nutmeg, sugar to taste,
1½ pint of milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the wine
into a bowl, with the grated nutmeg and
plenty of pounded sugar, and milk into
it the above proportion of milk from the
cow. Clouted cream may be laid on the
top, with pounded cinnamon or nutmeg
and sugar; and a little brandy may be
added to the wine before the milk is put
in. In some counties, cider is substituted
for the wine: when this is used,
brandy must always be added. Warm
milk may be poured on from a spouted
jug or teapot; but it must be held very
high. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>SYLLABUBS, Whipped.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of cream, ¼
pint of sherry, half that quantity
of brandy, the juice of ½ lemon, a
little grated nutmeg, 3 oz. of pounded
sugar, whipped cream the same as for
trifle. <i>Mode.</i>—Mix all the ingredients
together, put the syllabub into glasses,
and over the top of them heap a little
whipped cream, made in the same manner
as for trifle. Solid syllabub is made by
whisking or milling the mixture to a stiff
froth, and putting it in the glasses, without
the whipped cream at the top.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to fill
8 or 9 glasses. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3><a id="SYRUP"></a>SYRUP for Jellies, to Clarify.</h3>

1 egg. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the sugar and water
into a stewpan; set it on the fire, and,
when the sugar is dissolved, add the
white of the egg, whipped up with a little
water. Whisk the whole well together,
and simmer very gently until it has
thrown up all the scum. Take this off
as it rises, strain the syrup through a fine
sieve or cloth into a basin, and keep it
for use.</p>


<h3>TAPIOCA PUDDING.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 oz. of tapioca, 1 quart
of milk, 2 oz. of butter, ¼ lb. of sugar,
4 eggs, flavouring of vanilla, grated
lemon-rind, or bitter almonds. <i>Mode.</i>—Wash
the tapioca, and let it stew
gently in the milk by the side of the
fire for ¼ hour, occasionally stirring it;
then let it cool a little; mix with it the
butter, sugar, and eggs, which should be
wall beaten, and flavour with either of
the above ingredients, putting in about
12 drops of the essence of almonds or
vanilla, whichever is preferred. Butter
a pie-dish, and line the edges with puff-paste;
put in the pudding, and bake in a
moderate oven for an hour. If the pudding
is boiled, add a little more tapioca,
and boil it in a buttered basin 1½ hour.
<i>Time.</i>—1 hour to bake, 1½ hour to boil.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or
6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>TAPIOCA SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—5 oz. of tapioca, 2 quarts

all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8
persons.</p>


<h3>TARTLETS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Trimmings of puff-paste,
any jam or marmalade that may be preferred.
<i>Mode.</i>—Roll out the paste to
the thickness of about ½ inch; butter
some small round patty-pans, line them
with it, and cut off the superfluous paste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
close to the edge of the pan. Put a
small piece of bread into each tartlet
(this is to keep
them in shape),
and bake in a
brisk oven for
about 10 minutes,
or rather
longer. When
they are done,
and are of a nice
colour, take the pieces of bread out
carefully, and replace them by a spoonful
of jam or marmalade. Dish them
high on a white d’oyley, piled high in
the centre, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—10 to 15
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> each. <i>Sufficient.</i>—1
lb. of paste will make 2 dishes
of tartlets. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

</div>


<h3>TARTLETS, Polish.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Puff-paste, the white of
an egg, pounded sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Roll
some good puff-paste out thin, and cut it
into 2½-inch squares; brush each square
over with the white of an egg, then fold
down the corners, so that they all meet
in the middle of each piece of paste;
slightly press the two pieces together,
brush them over with the egg, sift over
sugar, and bake in a nice quick oven for
about ¼ hour. When they are done,
make a little hole in the middle of the
paste, and fill it up with apricot jam,
marmalade, or red-currant jelly. Pile
them high in the centre of a dish, on a
napkin, and garnish with the same preserve
the tartlets are filled with. <i>Time.</i>—¼
hour or 20 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
with ½ lb. of puff-paste, 1<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for
2 dishes of pastry. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—It should be borne in mind,
that, for all dishes of small pastry, such
as the preceding, trimmings of puff-paste,
left from larger tarts, answer as
well as making the paste expressly.</p>


<h3>TEA, to make.</h3>

<p>There is very little art in making
good tea; if the water is boiling, and
there is no sparing of the fragrant leaf,
the beverage will almost invariably be
good. The old-fashioned plan of allowing
a teaspoonful to each person, and
one over, is still practised. Warm the
teapot with boiling water; let it remain
for two or three minutes for the vessel
to become thoroughly hot, then pour it
away. Put in the tea, pour in from ½
to ¾ pint of <i>boiling</i> water, close the lid,
and let it stand for the tea to draw
from 5 to 10 minutes; then fill up the
pot with water. The tea will be quite
spoiled unless made with water that is
actually <i>boiling</i>, as the leaves will not
open, and the flavour not be extracted
from them; the beverage will consequently
be colourless and tasteless,—in
fact, nothing but tepid water. Where
there is a very large party to make tea
for, it is a good plan to have two teapots,
instead of putting a large quantity
of tea into one pot; the tea, besides,
will go farther. When the infusion has
been once completed, the addition of
fresh tea adds very little to the strength;
so, when more is required, have the
pot emptied of the old leaves, scalded,
and fresh tea made in the usual manner.
Economists say that a few grains of carbonate
of soda, added before the boiling
water is poured on the tea, assist to
draw out the goodness; if the water is
very hard, perhaps it is a good plan,
as the soda softens it; but care must
be taken to use this ingredient sparingly,
as it is liable to give the tea a
soapy taste if added in too large a
quantity. For mixed tea, the usual
proportion is four spoonfuls of black to
one of green; more of the latter when
the flavour is very much liked; but strong
green tea is highly pernicious, and should
never be partaken of too freely. <i>Time.</i>—2
minutes to warm the teapot, 5 to 10
minutes to draw the strength from the
tea. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow 1 teaspoonful to
each person.</p>


<h3>TEA-CAKES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of flour, ½ teaspoonful
of salt, ¼ lb. of butter or lard,
1 egg, a piece of German yeast the size
of a walnut, warm milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the
flour (which should be perfectly dry) into
a basin; mix with it the salt, and rub in
the butter or lard; then beat the egg
well, stir to it the yeast, and add these
to the flour with as much warm milk as
will make the whole into a smooth paste,
and knead it well. Let it rise near the
fire, and, when well risen, form it into
cakes; place them on tins, let them rise
again for a few minutes before putting
them into the oven, and bake from ¼ to
½ hour in a moderate oven. These are
very nice with a few currants and a little
sugar added to the other ingredients,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
they should be put in after the butter is
rubbed in. These cakes should be buttered,
and eaten hot as soon as baked;
but, when stale, they are very nice split
and toasted; or, if dipped in milk, or
even water, and covered with a basin in
the oven till hot, they will be almost
equal to new. <i>Time.</i>—¼ to ½ hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to make
8 tea-cakes. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>TEA-CAKES, to toast.</h3>

<p>Cut each tea-cake into three or four
slices, according to its thickness; toast
them on both sides before a nice clear
fire, and as each slice is done, spread it
with butter on
both sides.
When a cake is
toasted, pile the
slices one on the
top of the other, cut them into quarters,
put them on a very hot plate, and send
the cakes immediately to table. As
they are wanted, send them in hot, one
or two at a time, as, if allowed to
stand, they spoil, unless kept in a muffin-plate
over a basin of boiling water.</p>

generally better flavoured; truss them
in the same manner as wild duck; roast
them before a brisk fire, and keep them
well basted. Serve with brown or orange
gravy, water-cresses, and a cut lemon.
The remains of teal make excellent hash.
<i>Time.</i>—From 9 to 15 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> each; but seldom bought. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2
for a dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from
October to February.</p>

breasts of veal, white stock, 1 faggot of
savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace,
4 cloves, 2 carrots, 2 onions, a strip of
lemon-peel. <i>Mode.</i>—The <i>tendrons</i> or
gristles, which are found round the front
of a breast of veal, are now very frequently
served as an entrée, and when
well dressed, make a nice and favourite
dish. Detach the gristles from the bone,
and cut them neatly out, so as not to
spoil the joint for roasting or stewing.
Put them into a stewpan, with sufficient
stock to cover them; add the herbs,
mace, cloves, carrots, onions, and lemon,
and simmer these for nearly, or quite, 4
hours. They should be stewed until a
fork will enter the meat easily. Take
them up, drain them, strain the gravy,

gherkins, 8 quenelles, or forcemeat balls,
12 crayfish, 12 croûtons. <i>Mode.</i>—Half
a calf’s head is sufficient to make a good
entrée, and if there are any remains of a
cold one left from the preceding day, it
will answer very well for this dish. After
boiling the head until tender, remove
the bones, and cut the meat into neat
pieces; put the stock into a stewpan,
add the wine, and a seasoning of salt and
cayenne; fry the mushrooms in butter

<h3>TOAST, to make Dry.</h3>

<p>To make dry toast properly, a great
deal of attention is required; much more,
indeed, than people generally suppose.
Never use new bread for making any
kind of toast, as it eats heavy, and,
besides, is very extravagant. Procure a
loaf of household bread about two days
old; cut off as many slices as may be
required, not quite ¼ inch in thickness;
trim off the crusts and ragged edges, put
the bread on a toasting-fork, and hold it
before a very clear fire. Move it backwards
and forwards until the bread is
nicely coloured; then turn it and toast
the other side, and do not place it so near
the fire that it blackens. Dry toast should
be more gradually made than buttered
toast, as its great beauty consists in its
crispness, and this cannot be attained
unless the process is slow and the bread
is allowed gradually to colour. It should
never be made long before it is wanted,
as it soon becomes tough, unless placed
on the fender in front of the fire. As
soon as each piece is ready, it should be
put into a rack, or stood upon its edges,
and sent quickly to table.</p>


<h3>TOAST, to make Hot Buttered.</h3>

<p>A loaf of household bread about two
days old answers for making toast better
than cottage bread, the latter not being
a good shape, and too crusty for the purpose.
Cut as many nice even slices as
may be required, rather more than ¼ inch
in thickness, and toast them before a
very bright fire, without allowing the
bread to blacken, which spoils the appearance
and flavour of all toast. When
of a nice colour on both sides, put it on a
hot plate; divide some good butter into
small pieces, place them on the toast, set
this before the fire, and when the butter
is just beginning to melt, spread it lightly
over the toast. Trim off the crust and
ragged edges, divide each round into 4
pieces, and send the toast quickly to
table. Some persons cut the slices of
toast across from corner to corner, so
making the pieces of a three-cornered
shape. Soyer recommends that each
slice should be cut into pieces as soon as
it is buttered, and when all are ready,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
that they should be piled lightly on the
dish they are intended to be served on.
He says that by cutting through 4 or 5
slices at a time, all the butter is squeezed
out of the upper ones, while the bottom
one is swimming in fat liquid. It is
highly essential to use good butter for
making this dish.</p>


<h3>TOAST-AND-WATER.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A slice of bread, 1 quart
of boiling water. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut a slice
from a stale loaf (a piece of hard crust is
better than anything else for the purpose),
toast it of a nice brown on every
side, but <i>do not allow it to burn or blacken</i>.
Put it into a jug, pour the boiling water
over it, cover it closely, and let it remain
until cold. When strained, it will be
ready for use. Toast-and-water should
always be made a short time before it is
required, to enable it to get cold: if
drunk in a tepid or lukewarm state, it is
an exceedingly disagreeable beverage.
If, as is sometimes the case, this drink is
wanted in a hurry, put the toasted bread
into a jug, and only just cover it with the
boiling water; when this is cool, cold water
may be added in the proportion required,
the toast-and-water strained; it will then
be ready for use, and is more expeditiously
prepared than by the above method.</p>


<h3>TOAST SANDWICHES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Thin cold toast, thin
slices of bread-and-butter, pepper and
salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Place a very thin
piece of cold toast between 2 slices of
thin bread-and-butter in the form of a
sandwich, adding a seasoning of pepper
and salt. This sandwich may be varied
by adding a little pulled meat, or very
fine slices of cold meat, to the toast, and
in any of these forms will be found very
tempting to the appetite of an invalid.</p>


<h3>TOFFEE, Everton.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of powdered loaf
sugar, 1 teacupful of water, ¼ lb. of
butter, 6 drops of essence of lemon.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the water and sugar into a
brass pan, and beat the butter to a cream.
When the sugar is dissolved, add the
butter, and keep stirring the mixture
over the fire until it sets, when a little is
poured on to a buttered dish; and just
before the toffee is done, add the essence
of lemon. Butter a dish or tin, pour on
it the mixture, and when cool, it will
easily separate from the dish. Butter-Scotch,
an excellent thing for coughs,
is made with brown, instead of white
sugar, omitting the water, and flavoured
with ½ oz. of powdered ginger. It is
made in the same manner as toffee.
<i>Time.</i>—18 to 35 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to make a lb. of toffee.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SAUCE for Keeping
(Excellent).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every quart of tomato-pulp
allow 1 pint of cayenne vinegar,
¾ oz. of shalots, ¾ oz. of garlic, peeled
and cut in slices; salt to taste. To every
six quarts of liquor, 1 pint of soy, 1 pint
of anchovy-sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Gather the
tomatoes quite ripe; bake them in a
slow oven till tender; rub them through
a sieve, and to every quart of pulp add
cayenne vinegar, shalots, garlic, and salt,
in the above proportion; boil the whole
together till the garlic and shalots are
quite soft; then rub it through a sieve,
put it again into a saucepan, and, to
every six quarts of the liquor, add 1 pint
of soy and the same quantity of anchovy-sauce,
and boil altogether for about 20
minutes; bottle off for use, and carefully
seal or resin the corks. This will keep
good for 2 or 3 years, but will be fit for
use in a week. A useful and less expensive
sauce may be made by omitting the
anchovy and soy. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether 1
hour. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make this from the
middle of September to the end of October.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SAUCE for Keeping
(Excellent).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 dozen tomatoes, 2 teaspoonfuls
of the best powdered ginger,
1 dessertspoonful of salt, 1 head of garlic
chopped fine, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar,
1 dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar (a
small quantity of cayenne may be substituted
for this). <i>Mode.</i>—Choose ripe
tomatoes, put them into a stone jar, and
stand them in a cool oven until quite
tender; when cold, take the skins and
stalks from them, mix the pulp with the
liquor which is in the jar, but do not
strain it; add all the other ingredients,
mix well together, and put it into well-sealed
bottles. Stored away in a cool,
dry place, it will keep good for years.
It is ready for use as soon as made, but
the flavour is better after a week or two.
Should it not appear to keep, turn it
out, and boil it up with a little additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
ginger and cayenne. For immediate use,
the skins should be put into a wide-mouthed
bottle with a little of the different
ingredients, and they will be found
very nice for hashes or stews. <i>Time.</i>—4
or 5 hours in a <i>cool</i> oven. <i>Seasonable</i>
from the middle of September to the end
of October.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SAUCE for Keeping
(Excellent).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 dozen tomatoes; to
every pound of tomato-pulp allow 1 pint
of Chili vinegar, 1 oz. of garlic, 1 oz. of
shalot, 2 oz. of salt, 1 large green capsicum,
½ teaspoonful of cayenne, 2 pickled
gherkins, 6 pickled onions, 1 pint of
common vinegar, and the juice of 6 lemons.
<i>Mode.</i>—Choose the tomatoes
when quite ripe and red; put them in a
jar with a cover to it, and bake them till
tender. The better way is to put them
in the oven overnight, when it will not
be too hot, and examine them in the
morning to see if they are tender. Do
not allow them to remain in the oven
long enough to break them; but they
should be sufficiently soft to skin nicely
and rub through the sieve. Measure the
pulp, and to each pound of pulp add the
above proportion of vinegar and other
ingredients, taking care to chop very fine
the garlic, shalot, capsicum, onion, and
gherkins. Boil the whole together till
everything is tender; then again rub it
through a sieve, and add the lemon-juice.
Now boil the whole again till it becomes
as thick as cream, and keep continually
stirring; bottle it when quite cold, cork
well, and seal the corks. If the flavour
of garlic and shalot is very much disliked,
diminish the quantities. <i>Time.</i>—Bake
the tomatoes in a <i>cool</i> oven all night.
<i>Seasonable</i> from the middle of September
to the end of October.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A quantity of liquor will flow
from the tomatoes, which must be put
through the sieve with the rest. Keep it
well stirred whilst on the fire, and use a
wooden spoon.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SAUCE, Hot, to serve
with Cutlets, Roast Meats, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 tomatoes, 2 shalots,
1 clove, 1 blade of mace, salt and cayenne
to taste, ¼ pint of gravy or stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the tomatoes in two, and squeeze the
juice and seeds out; put them in a stewpan
with all the ingredients, and let them
simmer <i>gently</i> until the tomatoes are
tender enough to pulp; rub the whole
through a sieve, boil it for a few minutes,
and serve. The shalots and spices may
be omitted when their flavour is objected
to. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour, or rather more, to
simmer the tomatoes. <i>Average cost</i>, for
this quantity, 1<i>s.</i> <i>In full season</i> in September
and October.</p>


<h3>TOMATOES, Baked (Excellent).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 or 10 tomatoes, pepper
and salt to taste, 2 oz. of butter, bread-crumbs.
<i>Mode.</i>—Take off the stalks
from the tomatoes; cut them into thick
slices, and put them into a deep baking-dish;
add a plentiful seasoning of pepper
and salt, and butter in the above proportion;
cover the whole with bread-crumbs;
drop over these a little clarified
butter; bake in a moderate oven from
20 minutes to ½ hour, and serve very hot.
This vegetable dressed as above, is an
exceedingly nice accompaniment to all
kinds of roast meat. The tomatoes, instead
of being cut in slices, may be baked
whole; but they will take rather longer
time to cook. <i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to ½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, in full season, 9<i>d.</i>
per basket. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> in August, September, and
October; but may be had, forced, much
earlier.</p>


<h3>TOMATOES, Baked (another
Mode).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Some bread-crumbs, a
little butter, onion, cayenne, and salt.
<i>Mode.</i>—Bake the tomatoes whole, then
scoop out a small hole at the top; fry
the bread-crumbs, onion, &amp;c., and fill the
holes with this as high up as possible;
then brown the tomatoes with a salamander,
or in an oven, and take care that
the skin does not break.</p>


<h3>TOMATOES, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 tomatoes, pepper and
salt to taste, 2 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls
of vinegar. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice the
tomatoes into a <i>lined</i> saucepan; season
them with pepper and salt, and place
small pieces of butter on them. Cover
the lid down closely, and stew from 20 to
25 minutes, or until the tomatoes are
perfectly tender; add the vinegar, stir
two or three times, and serve with any
kind of roast meat, with which they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
be found a delicious accompaniment.
<i>Time.</i>—20 to 25 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,
in full season, 9<i>d.</i> per basket. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from
August to October; but may be had,

<h3>TOMATOES, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 tomatoes, about ½ pint
of good gravy, thickening of butter and
flour, cayenne and salt to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Take
out the stalks of the tomatoes;
put them into a wide stewpan, pour over
them the above proportion of good brown
gravy, and stew gently until they are
tender, occasionally <i>carefully</i> turning
them, that they may be equally done.
Thicken the gravy with a little butter
and flour worked together on a plate;
let it just boil up after the thickening is
added, and serve. If it be at hand,
these should be served on a silver or
plated vegetable-dish. <i>Time.</i>—20 to 25
minutes, very gentle stewing. <i>Average
cost</i>, in full season, 9<i>d.</i> per basket. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
in August, September, and October;
but may be had, forced, much earlier.</p>


<h3>TONGUE, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 tongue, a bunch of savoury
herbs, water. <i>Mode.</i>—In choosing
a tongue, ascertain how long it has been
dried or pickled, and select one with a
smooth skin, which denotes its being
young and tender. If a dried one, and
rather hard, soak it at least for 12 hours
previous to cooking it; if, however, it is
fresh from the pickle, 2 or 3 hours will be
sufficient for it to remain in soak. Put
the tongue into a stewpan with plenty of
cold water and a bunch of savoury herbs;
let it gradually come to a boil, skim well,
and simmer very gently until tender.
Peel off the skin, garnish with tufts
of cauliflowers or Brussels sprouts, and
serve. Boiled tongue is frequently sent
to table with boiled poultry, instead of
ham, and is, by many persons, preferred.
If to serve cold, peel it, fasten it down to
a piece of board by sticking a fork through
the root, and another through the top, to
straighten it. When cold, glaze it, and
put a paper ruche round the root, and
garnish with tufts of parsley. <i>Time.</i>—A
large smoked tongue, 4 to 4½ hours; a
small one, 2½ to 3 hours. A large unsmoked
tongue, 3 to 3½ hours; a small
one, 2 to 2½ hours. <i>Average cost</i>, for a
moderate-sized tongue, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>TONGUES, to Cure.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—For a tongue of 7 lbs.,
1 oz. of saltpetre, ½ oz. of black pepper,
4 oz. of sugar, 3 oz. of juniper berries,
6 oz. of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub the above
ingredients well into the tongue, and let
it remain in the pickle for 10 days or a
fortnight; then drain it, tie it up in
brown paper, and have it smoked for
about 20 days over a wood fire; or it
may be boiled out of this pickle. <i>Time.</i>—From
10 to 14 days to remain in the
pickle; to be smoked 24 days. <i>Average
cost</i>, for a medium-sized uncured tongue,
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—If not wanted immediately, the
tongue will keep 3 or 4 weeks without
being too salt; then it must not be
rubbed, but only turned in the pickle.</p>


<h3>TONGUES, to Cure.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—9 lbs. of salt, 8 oz. of
sugar, 9 oz. of powdered saltpetre. <i>Mode.</i>—Rub
the above ingredients well into
the tongues, and keep them in this
curing mixture for 2 months, turning
them every day. Drain them from the
pickle, cover with brown paper, and have
them smoked for about 3 weeks. <i>Time.</i>—The
tongues to remain in pickle 2
months; to be smoked 3 weeks. <i>Sufficient.</i>—The
above quantity of brine sufficient
for 12 tongues, of 5 lbs. each.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>TONGUE, to Pickle and Dress a,
to Eat Cold.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of salt, 2 oz. of bay-salt,
1 oz. of saltpetre, 3 oz. of coarse
sugar; cloves, mace, and allspice to taste;
butter, common crust of flour and water.
<i>Mode.</i>—Lay the tongue for a fortnight in
the above pickle, turn it every day, and
be particular that the spices are well
pounded; put it into a small pan just
large enough to hold it, place some pieces
of butter on it, and cover with a common
crust. Bake in a slow oven until so
tender that a straw would penetrate it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
take off the skin, fasten it down to a
piece of board by running a fork through
the root, and another through the tip, at
the same time straightening it and putting
it into shape. When cold, glaze it,
put a paper ruche round the root, which
is generally very unsightly, and garnish
with tufts of parsley. <i>Time.</i>—From 3
to 4 hours in a slow oven, according to
size. <i>Average cost</i>, for a medium-sized
uncured tongue, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>TREACLE PUDDING, Rolled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 lb. of suet crust, ¼ lb.
of treacle, ½ teaspoonful of grated ginger.
<i>Mode.</i>—Make, with 1 lb. of flour, a suet
crust by our given recipe, roll it out to
the thickness of ½ inch, and spread the
treacle equally over it, leaving a small
margin where the paste joins; close the
ends securely, tie the pudding in a
floured cloth, plunge it into boiling
water, and boil for 2 hours. We have
inserted this pudding, being economical,
and a favourite one with children; it is,
of course, only suitable for a nursery, or
very plain family dinner. Made with a
lard instead of a suet crust, it would be
very nice baked, and would be sufficiently
done in from 1½ to 2 hours.
<i>Time.</i>—Boiled pudding, 2 hours; baked
pudding, 1½ to 2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>TRIFLE, to make a.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/illus-345.jpg" width="203" height="231" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">TRIFLE.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—For the whip, 1 pint of
cream, 3 oz. of pounded sugar, the
white of 2 eggs, a small glass of sherry
or raisin wine. For the trifle, 1 pint of
custard, made with 8 eggs to a pint of
milk; 6 small sponge-cakes, or 6 slices of
sponge-cake; 12 macaroons, 2 dozen
ratafias, 2 oz. of sweet almonds, the
grated rind of 1 lemon, a layer of raspberry
or strawberry jam, ½ pint of sherry
or sweet wine, 6 tablespoonfuls of brandy.</p>

<p><i>Mode.</i>—The whip to lay over the top
of the trifle should be made the day before
it is required for table, as the flavour is
better, and it is much more solid than
when prepared the same day. Put into
a large bowl the pounded sugar, the
whites of the eggs, which should be
beaten to a stiff froth, a glass of sherry
or sweet wine, and the cream. Whisk
these ingredients well in a cool place,
and take off the froth with a skimmer as
fast as it rises, and put it on a sieve to
drain; continue the whisking till there
is sufficient of the whip, which must be
put away in a
cool place to
drain. The next
day, place the
sponge-cakes,
macaroons, and
ratafias at the
bottom of a trifle-dish;
pour over
them ½ pint of
sherry or sweet
wine, mixed with
6 tablespoonfuls
of brandy, and,
should this proportion
of wine not be found quite sufficient,
add a little more, as the cakes
should be well soaked. Over the cakes
pat the grated lemon-rind, the sweet
almonds, blanched and cut into strips,
and a layer of raspberry or strawberry
jam. Make a good custard, by recipe,
using 8 instead of 5 eggs to the pint of
milk, and let this cool a little; then
pour it over the cakes, &amp;c. The whip
being made the day previously, and the
trifle prepared, there remains nothing
to do now but heap the whip lightly over
the top: this should stand as high as
possible, and it may be garnished with
strips of bright currant jelly (see illustration),
crystallized sweetmeats, or flowers;
the small coloured comfits are sometimes
used for the purpose of garnishing a trifle,
but they are now considered rather old-fashioned.
<i>Average cost</i>, with cream at
1<i>s.</i> per pint, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 trifle.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>TRIFLE, Indian.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 quart of milk, the rind
of ½ large lemon, sugar to taste, 5 heaped
tablespoonfuls of rice-flour, 1 oz. of sweet
almonds, ½ pint of custard.</p>

<p><i>Mode.</i>—Boil the milk and lemon-rind
together until the former is well flavoured;
take out the lemon-rind and stir in the
rice-flour, which should first be moistened
with cold milk, and add sufficient loaf
sugar to sweeten it nicely. Boil gently
for about 5 minutes, and keep the mixture
stirred; take it off the fire, let it
cool a <i>little</i>, and pour it into a glass dish.
When cold, cut the rice out in the form
of a star, or any other shape that may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
preferred; take out the spare rice, and
fill the space with boiled custard. Blanch
and cut the almonds into strips; stick
them over the trifle, and garnish it with
pieces of bright-coloured jelly, or preserved
fruits, or candied citron. <i>Time.</i>—¼
hour to simmer the milk, 5 minutes
after the rice is added. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 1 trifle. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>TRIPE, to Dress.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Tripe, onion sauce, milk
and water. <i>Mode.</i>—Ascertain that the
tripe is quite fresh, and have it cleaned
and dressed. Cut away the coarsest fat,
and boil it in equal proportions of milk
and water for ¾ hour. Should the tripe
be entirely undressed, more than double
that time should be allowed for it. Have
ready some onion sauce, made by our
given recipe, dish the tripe, smother it
with the sauce, and the remainder send
to table in a tureen. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour; for
undressed tripe, from 2½ to three hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 7<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Tripe may be dressed in a
variety of ways: it may be cut in pieces
and fried in batter, stewed in gravy with
mushrooms, or cut into collops, sprinkled
with minced onion and savoury herbs,
and fried a nice brown in clarified butter.</p>


<h3>TROUT, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 middling-sized trout,
½ onion cut in thin slices, a little parsley,
2 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 bay-leaves,
a little thyme, salt and pepper to taste,
1 pint of medium stock, 1 glass of port
wine, thickening of butter and flour.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the fish very clean, and
wipe it quite dry. Lay it in a stewpan,
with all the ingredients but the butter
and flour, and simmer gently for ½
hour, or rather more, should not the fish
be quite done. Take it out, strain the
gravy, add the thickening, and stir it
over a sharp fire for 5 minutes; pour it
over the trout, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—According
to size, ½ hour or more. <i>Average
cost.</i>—Seldom bought. <i>Seasonable</i>
from May to September, and fatter from
the middle to the end of August than at
any other time. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons.
Trout may be served with anchovy or
caper sauce, baked in buttered paper, or
fried whole like smelts. Trout dressed à
la Genévése is extremely delicate; for
this proceed the same as with salmon.</p>


<h3>TRUFFLES, to Dress, with Champagne.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—12 fine black truffles, a
few slices of fat bacon, 1 carrot, 1 turnip,
2 onions, a bunch of savoury herbs,
including parsley, 1 bay-leaf, 2 cloves, 1
blade of pounded mace, 2 glasses of
champagne, ½ pint of stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Carefully
select the truffles, reject those
that have a musty smell, and wash them
well with a brush, in cold water only,
until perfectly clean. Put the bacon
into a stewpan, with the truffles and the
remaining ingredients; simmer these
gently for an hour, and let the whole cool
in the stewpan. When to be served, re-warm
them, and drain them on a clean
cloth; then arrange them on a delicately
white napkin, that it may contrast as
strongly as possible with the truffles, and
serve. The trimmings of truffles are
used to flavour gravies, stock, sauces,
&amp;c.; and are an excellent addition to
ragoûts, made dishes of fowl, &amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour.
<i>Average cost.</i>—Not often
bought in this country. <i>Seasonable</i> from
November to March.</p>


<h3>TRUFFLES A L’ITALIENNE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—10 truffles, 1 tablespoonful
of minced parsley, 1 minced shalot,
salt and pepper to taste, 2 oz. of butter,
2 tablespoonfuls of good brown gravy,
the juice of ½ lemon, cayenne to taste.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the truffles and cut them
into slices about the size of a penny-piece;
put them into a frying-pan, with
the parsley, shalot, salt, pepper, and 1
oz. of butter; stir them over the fire,
that they may all be equally done, which
will be in about 10 minutes, and drain off
some of the butter; then add a little
more fresh butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of
good gravy, the juice of ½ lemon, and a
little cayenne; stir over the fire until the
whole is on the point of boiling, when
serve. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 20 minutes.
<i>Average cost.</i>—Not often bought in this
country. <i>Seasonable</i> from November to
March.</p>


<h3>TRUFFLES, Italian Mode  of
Dressing.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—10 truffles, ¼ pint of
salad-oil, pepper and salt to taste, 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
tablespoonful of minced parsley, a very
little finely minced garlic, 2 blades of
pounded mace, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.
<i>Mode.</i>—After cleansing and brushing
the truffles, cut them into thin slices,
and put them in a baking-dish, on a
seasoning of oil, pepper, salt, parsley,
garlic, and mace in the above proportion.
Bake them for nearly an hour, and, just
before serving, add the lemon-juice, and
send them to table very hot. <i>Time.</i>—Nearly
1 hour. <i>Average cost.</i>—Not often
bought in this country. <i>Seasonable</i> from
November to March.</p>


<h3>TRUFFLES AU NATUREL.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Truffles, buttered paper.
<i>Mode.</i>—Select some fine truffles; cleanse
them, by washing them in several waters
with a brush, until not a particle of sand
or grit remains on them; wrap each
truffle in buttered paper, and bake in
a hot oven for quite an hour; take off the
paper, wipe the truffles, and serve them
in a hot napkin. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour. <i>Average
cost.</i>—Not often bought in this country.
<i>Seasonable</i> from November to March.</p>


<h3>TURBOT.</h3>

<p>In choosing turbot see that it is thick,
and of a yellowish white; for if of a
bluish tint, it is not good. The turbot-kettle,
as will be seen by our cut, is made
differently from ordinary fish kettles, it
being less deep, whilst it is wider, and
more pointed at the sides; thus exactly
answering to the shape of the fish which
it is intended should be boiled in it.</p>

<div class="caption">TURBOT-KETTLE.</div>
</div>


<h3>TURBOT, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—6 oz. of salt to each gallon
of water. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose a middling-sized
turbot; for they are invariably the
most valuable: if very large, the meat
will be tough and thready. Three or
four hours before dressing, soak the fish
in salt and water to take off the slime;
then thoroughly cleanse it, and with a
knife make an incision down the middle
of the back, to prevent the skin of the
belly from cracking. Rub it over with
lemon, and be particular not to cut off
the fins. Lay the fish in a very clean
turbot-kettle, with sufficient cold water
to cover it, and salt in the above proportion.
Let it gradually come to a boil,
and skim very carefully; keep it gently
simmering, and on no account let it boil
fast, as the fish would have a very
unsightly appearance. When the meat
separates easily from the bone, it is
done; then take it out, let it drain well,
and dish it on a hot napkin. Rub a little
lobster spawn through a sieve, sprinkle
it over the fish, and garnish with tufts of
parsley and cut lemon. Lobster or shrimp
sauce, and plain melted butter, should be
sent to table with it. <i>Time.</i>—After
the water boils, about ½ hour for a
large turbot; middling size, about 20
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>,—large turbot,
from 10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i>; middling size, from
12<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.
<i>Sufficient</i>, 1 middling-sized turbot for
8 persons.</p>


<h3>TURBOT, to Help.</h3>

<p>First run the fish-slice down the thickest
part of the fish lengthwise, quite
through to the bone, and then cut handsome
and regular slices across the fish
until all the meat on the upper side
is helped. When the carver has removed
all the meat from the upper side of the
fish, the backbone should be raised, put
on one side of the dish, and the under
side helped as the upper.</p>


<h3>TURBOT À LA CREME.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold
turbot. For sauce, 2 oz. of butter, 4
tablespoonfuls of cream; salt, cayenne,
and pounded mace to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Clear
away all skin and bone from the flesh of
the turbot, which should be done when
it comes from table, as it causes less
waste when trimmed hot. Cut the flesh
into nice square pieces, as equally as
possible; put into a stewpan the butter,
let it melt, and add the cream and
seasoning; let it just simmer for one
minute, but not boil. Lay in the fish to
warm, and serve it garnished with
croûtons or a paste border. <i>Time.</i>—10
minutes. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The remains of cold salmon may
be dressed in this way, and the above
mixture may be served in a <i>vol-au-vent</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>


<h3>TURBOT, Baked Fillets of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold
turbot, lobster sauce left from the preceding
day, egg, and bread-crumbs;
cayenne and salt to taste; minced parsley,
nutmeg, lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—After
having cleared the fish from all skin and
bone, divide it into square pieces of an
equal size; brush them over with egg,
sprinkle with bread-crumbs mixed with a
little minced parsley and seasoning. Lay
the fillets in a baking-dish, with sufficient
butter to baste with. Bake for ¼ hour,
and do not forget to keep them well
moistened with the butter. Put a little
lemon-juice and grated nutmeg to the
cold lobster sauce; make it hot, and pour
over the fish, which must be well drained
from the butter. Garnish with parsley
and cut lemon. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ½
hour. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Cold turbot thus warmed in the
remains of lobster sauce will be found
much nicer than putting the fish again
in water.</p>


<h3>TURBOT  A  L’ITALIENNE,
Fillets of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold
turbot, Italian sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Clear
the fish carefully from the bone, and
take away all skin, which gives an unpleasant
flavour to the sauce. Make the
sauce hot, lay in the fish to warm
through, but do not let it boil. Garnish
with croûtons. <i>Time.</i>—5 minutes. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year.</p>


<h3>TURBOT, or other Large Fish,
Garnish for.</h3>

<p>Take the crumb of a stale loaf, cut it
into small pyramids with flat tops, and
on the top of each pyramid put rather
more than a tablespoonful of white of
egg beaten to a stiff froth. Over this,
sprinkle finely-chopped parsley and fine
raspings of a dark colour. Arrange
these on the napkin round the fish, one
green and one brown alternately.</p>


<h3>TURBOT AU GRATIN.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Remains of cold turbot,
béchamel (<i>see</i> <a href="#SAUCES">Sauces</a>), bread-crumbs,
butter.  <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the flesh of the
turbot into small dice, carefully freeing
it from all skin and bone. Put them
into a stewpan, and moisten with 4 or 5
tablespoonfuls of béchamel. Let it get
thoroughly hot, but do not allow it to
boil. Spread the mixture on a dish,
cover with finely-grated bread-crumbs,
and place small pieces of butter over
the top. Brown it in the oven, or with a
salamander. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, ½ hour.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>TURKEY, Boiled.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 264px;">
<img src="images/illus-348.jpg" width="264" height="115" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">BOILED TURKEY.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Turkey; forcemeat.
<i>Choosing and Trussing.</i>—Hen turkeys are
preferable for boiling, on account of their
whiteness and tenderness, and one of
moderate size should be selected, as a
large one is not suitable for this mode of
cooking. They should not be dressed
until they have been killed 3 or 4 days,
as they will neither look white, nor will
they be tender. Pluck the bird, carefully
draw, and singe it with a piece
of white paper; wash it inside and out,
and wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth.
Cut off the head and neck, draw the
strings or sinews of the thighs, and cut
off the legs at the first joint; draw the
legs into the body, fill the breast with
forcemeat; run a skewer through the
wing and the middle joint, of the leg,
quite into the leg and wing on the opposite
side; break the breastbone, and
make the bird look as round and as compact
as possible. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the turkey
into sufficient <i>hot</i> water to cover it; let it
come to a boil, then carefully remove all
the scum: if this is attended to, there is
no occasion to boil the bird in a floured
cloth; but it should be well covered with
the water. Let it simmer very gently for
about 1½ hour to 1¾ hour, according to the
size, and serve with either white, celery,
oyster,or mushroom sauce, or parsley-and-butter,
a little of which should be poured
over the turkey. Boiled ham, bacon,
tongue, or pickled pork, should always accompany
this dish; and when oyster sauce
is served, the turkey should be stuffed
with oyster forcemeat. <i>Time.</i>—A small
turkey, 1½ hour; a large one, 1¾ hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
<i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, but
more expensive at Christmas, on account
of the great demand. <i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or
8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from December to
February.</p>


<h3>TURKEY, Croquettes of (Cold
Meat Cookery).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold
turkey; to every ½ lb. of meat allow 2 oz.
of ham or bacon, 2 shalots, 1 oz. of butter,
1 tablespoonful of flour, the yolks of 2
eggs, egg and bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—The
smaller pieces, that will not do for a
fricassée or hash, answer very well for
this dish. Mince the meat finely with
ham or bacon in the above proportion;
make a gravy of the bones and trimmings,
well seasoning it; mince the shalots, put
them into a stewpan with the butter, add
the flour; mix well, then put in the
mince, and about ½ pint of the gravy
made from the bones. (The proportion
of the butter must be increased or diminished
according to the quantity of
mince.) When just boiled, add the yolks
of 2 eggs; put the mixture out to cool,
and then shape it in a wineglass. Cover
the croquettes with egg and bread-crumbs,
and fry them a delicate brown.
Put small pieces of parsley-stems for
stalks, and serve with rolled bacon cut
very thin. <i>Time.</i>—8 minutes to fry the
croquettes. <i>Seasonable</i> from December
to February.</p>


<h3>TURKEY, Fricasseed (Cold Meat
Cookery).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold roast
or boiled turkey; a strip of lemon-peel,
a bunch of savoury herbs, 1 onion, pepper
and salt to taste, 1 pint of water, 4
tablespoonfuls of cream, the yolk of an
egg. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut some nice slices from
the remains of a cold turkey, and put the
bones and trimmings into a stewpan,
with the lemon-peel, herbs, onion, pepper,
salt, and the water; stew for an
hour, strain the gravy, and lay in the
pieces of turkey. When warm through,
add the cream and the yolk of an egg;
stir it well round, and, when getting
thick, take out the pieces, lay them on a
hot dish, and pour the sauce over.
Garnish the fricassée with sippets of
toasted bread. Celery or cucumbers,
cut into small pieces, may be put into
the sauce; if the former, it must be
boiled first. <i>Time.</i>—1 hour to make the
gravy. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the
cold turkey, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from December
to February.</p>


<h3>TURKEY, Hashed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold roast
turkey, 1 onion, pepper and salt to taste,
rather more than 1 pint of water, 1 carrot,
1 turnip, 1 blade of mace, a bunch
of savoury herbs, 1 tablespoonful of
mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of
port wine, thickening of butter and
flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the turkey into neat
joints; the best pieces reserve for the
hash, the inferior joints and trimmings
put into a stewpan with an onion cut in
slices, pepper and salt, a carrot, turnip,
mace, herbs, and water in the above
proportion; simmer these for an hour,
then strain the gravy, thicken it with
butter and flour, flavour with ketchup
and port wine, and lay in the pieces of
turkey to warm through; if there is any
stuffing left, put that in also, as it so
much improves the flavour of the gravy.
When it boils, serve, and garnish the
dish with sippets of toasted bread.
<i>Time.</i>—1 hour to make the gravy. <i>Seasonable</i>
from December to February.</p>


<h3>TURKEY, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Turkey; forcemeat.
<i>Choosing and Trussing.</i>—Choose cock
turkeys by their short spurs and black
legs, in which case they are young; if
the spurs are long, and the legs pale and
rough, they are old. If the bird has
been long killed, the eyes will appear
sunk and the feet very dry; but, if fresh,
the contrary will be the case. Middling-sized
fleshy turkeys are by many persons
considered superior to those of an
immense growth, as they are, generally
speaking, much more tender. They
should never be dressed the same day
they are killed; but, in cold weather,
should hang at least 8 days; if the weather
is mild, 4 or 5 days will be found
sufficient. Carefully pluck the bird,
singe it with white paper, and wipe it
thoroughly with a cloth; draw it, preserve
the liver and gizzard, and be particular
not to break the gall-bag, as no
washing will remove the bitter taste it
imparts where it once touches. Wash it
<i>inside</i> well, and wipe it thoroughly dry
with a cloth; the <i>outside</i> merely requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
nicely wiping, as we have just stated.
Cut off the neck close to the back, but
leave enough of the crop-skin to turn
over; break the leg-bone close below the
knee, draw out the strings from the
thighs, and flatten the breastbone to
make it look plump. Have ready a
forcemeat; fill the breast with this, and,
if a trussing-needle is used, sew the neck
over to the back; if a needle is not at
hand, a skewer will answer the purpose.
Run a skewer through the pinion and
thigh into the body to the pinion and
thigh on the other side, and press the
legs as much as possible between the
breast and the side-bones, and put the
liver under one pinion and the gizzard
under the other. Pass a string across
the back of the bird, catch it over the
points of the skewer, tie it in the centre
of the back, and be particular that the
turkey is very firmly trussed. This may
be more easily accomplished with a
needle and twine than with skewers.
<i>Mode.</i>—Fasten a sheet of buttered paper
on to the breast of the bird, put it down
to a bright fire, at some little distance <i>at
first</i> (afterwards draw it nearer), and keep
it well basted the whole of the time it is
cooking. About ¼ hour before serving,
remove the paper, dredge the turkey
lightly with flour, and put a piece of
butter into the basting-ladle; as the
butter melts, baste the bird with it.
When of a nice brown and well frothed,
serve with a tureen of good brown gravy
and one of bread sauce. Fried sausages
are a favourite addition to roast turkey;
they make a pretty garnish, besides
adding very much to the flavour.
When these are not at hand, a few forcemeat
balls should be placed round the
dish as a garnish. Turkey may also be
stuffed with sausage-meat, and a chestnut
forcemeat with the chestnut sauce
is, by many persons, very much esteemed
as an accompaniment to this favourite
dish. <i>Time.</i>—Small turkey, 1½ hour;
moderate-sized one, about 10 lbs., 2
hours; large turkey, 2½ hours, or longer.
<i>Average cost</i>, from 10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i>, but expensive
at Christmas, on account of the
great demand. <i>Sufficient.</i>—A moderate-sized
turkey for 7 or 8 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from December to February.</p>

<h3>TURKEY, Roast.</h3>

<p>A noble dish is a turkey, roast or
boiled. A Christmas dinner, with the
middle-classes of this empire, would
scarcely be a Christmas dinner without
its turkey; and we can hardly imagine
an object of greater envy than is presented
by a respected portly pater-familias
carving, at the season devoted to
good cheer and genial charity, his own
fat turkey, and carving it well. The
only art consists, as in the carving of a
goose, in getting from the breast as many
fine slices as possible; and all must have
remarked the very great difference in
the large number of people whom a good
carver will find slices for, and the comparatively
few that a bad carver will
succeed in serving. As we have stated
in both the carving of a duck and goose,
the carver should commence cutting
slices to the wing, from 2 to 3, and then
proceed upwards towards the ridge of
the breastbone: this is not the usual
plan, but, in practice, will be found the
best. The breast is the only part which
is looked on as fine in a turkey, the legs
being very seldom cut off and eaten at
table: they are usually removed to the
kitchen, where they are taken off, as here
marked, to appear only in a form which
seems to have a special attraction at a
bachelor’s supper-table,—we mean devilled:
served in this way, they are especially
liked and relished. A boiled turkey
is carved in the same manner as
when roasted.</p>

<h3>TURKEY POULTS, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Turkey poult; butter.
<i>Choosing and Trussing.</i>—Choose a plump
bird, and truss it in the following manner:—After
it has been carefully plucked,
drawn, and singed, skin the neck, and
fasten the head under the wing; turn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
legs at the first joint, and bring the feet
close to the thighs, as a woodcock should
be trussed, <i>and do not stuff it</i>. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
it down to a bright fire, keep it well
basted, and at first place a piece of paper
on the breast to prevent its taking too
much colour. About 10 minutes before
serving, dredge it lightly with flour, and
baste well; when nicely frothed, send it
to table immediately, with a little gravy
in the dish, and some in a tureen. If at
hand, a few water-cresses may be placed
round the turkey as a garnish, or it may
be larded. <i>Time.</i>—About 1 hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 7<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> each. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6
or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—In full season
from June to October.</p>


<h3>TURKEY SOUP (a Seasonable
Dish at Christmas).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 quarts of medium stock,
the remains of a cold roast turkey, 2 oz.
of rice-flour or arrowroot, salt and pepper
to taste, 1 tablespoonful of Harvey’s
sauce or mushroom ketchup. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
up the turkey in small pieces, and
put it in the stock; let it simmer slowly
until the bones are quite clean. Take
the bones out, and work the soup through
a sieve; when cool, skim well. Mix the
rice-flour or arrowroot to a batter with a
little of the soup; add it with the seasoning
and sauce, or ketchup. Give one
boil, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—4 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i> at
Christmas. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Instead of thickening this soup,
vermicelli or macaroni may be served
in it.</p>


<h3>TURNIP SOUP</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—3 oz. of butter, 9 good-sized
turnips, 4 onions, 2 quarts of stock,
seasoning to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Melt the
butter in the stewpan, but do not let
it boil; wash, drain, and slice the turnips
and onions very thin; put them in the
butter, with a teacupful of stock, and
stew very gently for an hour. Then add
the remainder of the stock, and simmer
another hour. Rub it through a tammy,
put it back into the stewpan, but do not
let it boil. Serve very hot. <i>Time.</i>—2½
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
from October to March. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 8 persons.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—By adding a little cream, this
soup will be much improved.</p>


<h3>TURNIPS, Boiled.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Turnips; to each ½
gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful
of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare the
turnips, and, should they be very large,
divide them into quarters; but, unless
this is the case, let them be cooked whole.
Put them into a saucepan of boiling
water, salted in the above proportion,
and let them boil gently until tender.
Try them with a fork, and, when done,
take them up in a colander; let them
thoroughly drain, and serve. Boiled
turnips are usually sent to table with
boiled mutton, but are infinitely nicer
when mashed than served whole: unless
nice and young, they are scarcely worth
the trouble of dressing plainly as above.
<i>Time.</i>—Old turnips, ¾ to 1¼ hour; young
ones, about 18 to 20 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> per bunch. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow a
bunch of 12 turnips for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—May be had all the year;
but in spring only useful for flavouring
gravies, &amp;c.</p>

<p>TURNIPS, German Mode of
Cooking.</p>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—8 large turnips, 3 oz. of
butter, pepper and salt to taste, rather
more than ½ pint of weak stock or broth,
1 tablespoonful of flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
the butter hot in a stewpan, lay in the
turnips, after having pared and cut them
into dice, and season them with pepper
and salt. Toss them over the fire for a few
minutes, then add the broth, and simmer
the whole gently till the turnips are
tender. Brown the above proportion of
flour with a little butter; add this to the
turnips, let them simmer another 5
minutes, and serve. Boiled mutton is
usually sent to table with this vegetable,
and may be cooked with the turnips
by placing it in the midst of them: the
meat would then be very delicious, as,
there being so little liquid with the turnips,
it would almost be steamed, and,
consequently, very tender. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> per bunch.
<i>Sufficient</i> for 4 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—May
be had all the year.</p>


<h3>TURNIPS, Mashed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—10 or 12 large turnips;
to each ½ gallon of water allow 1 heaped
tablespoonful of salt, 2 oz. of butter,
cayenne or white paper to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—Pare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the turnips, quarter them, and put
them into boiling water, salted in the
above proportion; boil them until tender;
then drain them in a colander, and
squeeze them as dry as possible by
pressing them with the back of a large
plate. When quite free from water, rub
the turnips with a wooden spoon through
the colander, and put them into a very
clean saucepan; add the butter, white
pepper, or cayenne, and, if necessary, a
little salt. Keep stirring them over the
fire until the butter is well mixed with
them, and the turnips are thoroughly
hot; dish, and serve. A little cream or
milk added after the turnips are pressed
through the colander, is an improvement
to both the colour and flavour of this
vegetable. <i>Time.</i>—From ½ to ¾ hour to
boil the turnips; 10 minutes to warm
them through. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> per
bunch. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.
<i>Seasonable.</i>—May be had all the year; but
in early spring only good for flavouring
gravies.</p>


<h3>TURNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE.
(An Entremets, or to be served
with the Second Course as a Side-dish.)</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—7 or 8 turnips, 1 oz. of
butter, ½ pint of white sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Peel
and cut the turnips in the shape of
pears or marbles; boil them in salt and
water, to which has been added a little
butter, until tender; then take them out,
drain, arrange them on a dish, and pour
over the white sauce made by either
of the recipes, and to which has been
added a small lump of sugar. In winter,
when other vegetables are scarce, this
will be found a very good and pretty-looking
dish: when approved, a little
mustard may be added to the sauce.
<i>Time.</i>—About ¾ hour to boil the turnips.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> per bunch. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 1 side dish. <i>Seasonable</i> in winter.</p>


<h3>VANILLA CUSTARD SAUCE,
to serve with Puddings.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of milk, 2 eggs, 2
oz. of sugar, 10 drops of essence of vanilla.
<i>Mode.</i>—Beat the eggs, sweeten the milk;
stir these ingredients well together, and
flavour them with essence of vanilla,
regulating the proportion of this latter
ingredient by the strength of the essence,
the size of the eggs, &amp;c. Put the mixture
into a small jug, place this jug in a saucepan
of boiling water, and stir the sauce
<i>one way</i> until it thickens; but do not
allow it to boil, or it will instantly
curdle. Serve in a boat or tureen separately,
with plum, bread, or any kind of
dry pudding. Essence of bitter almonds
or lemon-rind may be substituted for the
vanilla, when they are more in accordance
with the flavouring of the pudding with
which the sauce is intended to be served.
<i>Time.</i>—To be stirred in the jug from 8
to 10 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 4 or 5 persons.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Baked (Cold Meat Cookery).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ lb. of cold roast veal, a
few slices of bacon, 1 pint of bread-crumbs,
½ pint of good veal gravy, ½
teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 blade
of pounded mace, cayenne and salt to
taste, 4 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince finely the
veal and bacon; add the bread-crumbs,
gravy, and seasoning, and stir these
ingredients well together. Beat up the
eggs thoroughly; add these, mix the
whole well together, put into a dish, and
bake from ¾ to 1 hour. When liked, a
little good gravy may be served in a
tureen as an accompaniment. <i>Time.</i>—from
¾ to 1 hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the cold meat, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 3 or
4 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from March to
October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Roast Breast of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Veal; a little flour.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the veal, well wipe it, and
dredge it with flour; put it down to a
bright fire, not too near, as it should not
be scorched. Baste it plentifully until
done; dish it, pour over the meat some
good melted butter, and send to table
with it a piece of boiled bacon and a cut
lemon. <i>Time.</i>—From 1½ to 2 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 8½<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for
5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from March
to October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Breast of, to Carve.</h3>

<p>The carving of a breast of veal is not
dissimilar to that of a fore-quarter of
lamb, when the shoulder has been taken
off. The breast of veal consists of two
parts,—the rib-bones and the gristly
brisket. These two parts should first be
separated by sharply passing the knife
in the direction of the lines 1, 2; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
they are entirely divided, the rib-bones
should be carved in the direction of the
lines 5 to 6; and the brisket can be
helped by cutting pieces in the direction
3 to 4. The carver should ask the
guests whether they have a preference
for the brisket or ribs; and if there be
a sweetbread served with the dish, as
it often is with roast breast of veal,
each person should receive a piece.</p>

<h3>VEAL, Stewed Breast of, and Peas.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Breast of veal, 2 oz. of
butter, a bunch of savoury herbs, including
parsley; 2 blades of pounded
mace, 2 cloves, 5 or 6 young onions,
1 strip of lemon-peel, 6 allspice, ¼ teaspoonful
of pepper, 1 teaspoonful of
salt, thickening of butter and flour,
2 tablespoonfuls of sherry, 2 tablespoonfuls
of tomato sauce, 1 tablespoonful of
lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom
ketchup, green peas. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the breast in half, after removing the
bone underneath, and divide the meat
into convenient-sized pieces. Put the
butter into a frying-pan, lay in the pieces
of veal, and fry until of a nice brown colour.
Now place these in a stewpan with
the herbs, mace, cloves, onions, lemon-peel,
allspice, and seasoning; pour over
them just sufficient boiling water to
cover the meat; well close the lid, and
let the whole simmer very gently for
about 2 hours. Strain off as much gravy
as is required, thicken it with butter and
flour, add the remaining ingredients,
skim well, let it simmer for about
10 minutes, then pour it over the meat.
Have ready some green peas, boiled
separately; sprinkle these over the veal,
and serve. It may be garnished with
forcemeat balls, or rashers of bacon
curled and fried. Instead of cutting up
the meat, many persons prefer it dressed
whole;—in that case it should be half-roasted
before the water, &amp;c. are put to
it. <i>Time.</i>—2¼ hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 8½<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from March to October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, à la Bourgeoise (Excellent).</h3>

neck of veal, 10 or 12 young carrots, a
bunch of green onions, 2 slices of lean
bacon, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 bunch
of savoury herbs, pepper and salt to
taste, a few new potatoes, 1 pint of
green peas. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the veal into
cutlets, trim them, and put the trimmings
into a stewpan with a little butter; lay
in the cutlets and fry them a nice brown
colour on both sides. Add the bacon,
carrots, onions, spice, herbs, and seasoning;
pour in about a pint of boiling
water, and stew gently for 2 hours on a
very slow fire. When done, skim off
the fat, take out the herbs, and flavour
the gravy with a little tomato sauce
and ketchup. Have ready the peas and
potatoes, boiled <i>separately</i>; put them
with the veal, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—2
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from June
to August with peas;—rather earlier
when these are omitted.</p>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A few slices of cold roast
veal, a few slices of cold ham, 2 hard-boiled
eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced
parsley, a little pepper, good gravy.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut off all the brown outside from
the veal, and cut the eggs into slices.
Procure a pretty mould; lay veal, ham,
eggs, and parsley in layers, with a little
pepper between each, and when the
mould is full, get some <i>strong</i> stock, and
fill up the shape. Bake for ½ hour, and
when cold, turn it out. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour.
<i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

veal, 4 onions, 2 apples sliced, 1 tablespoonful
of curry-powder, 1 dessertspoonful
of flour, ½ pint of broth or water,
1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice. <i>Mode.</i>—Slice
the onions and apples, and fry
them in a little butter; then take them
out, cut the meat into neat cutlets, and
fry these of a pale brown; add the curry-powder
and flour, put in the onion,
apples, and a little broth or water, and
stew gently till quite tender; add the
lemon-juice, and serve with an edging of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
boiled rice. The curry may be ornamented
with pickles, capsicums, and
gherkins, arranged prettily on the top.
<i>Time.</i>—¾ hour. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive
of the meat, 4<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from March
to October.</p>


<h3>VEAL CUTLETS (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—About 3 lbs. of the prime
part of the leg of veal, egg and bread-crumbs,
3 tablespoonfuls of minced savoury
herbs, salt and pepper to taste, a
small piece of butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Have the
veal cut into slices about ¾ of an inch in
thickness, and, if not cut perfectly even,
level the meat with a cutlet-bat or
rolling-pin. Shape and trim the cutlets,
and brush them
over with egg.
Sprinkle with
bread-crumbs,
with which have
been mixed
minced herbs
and a seasoning
of pepper and
salt, and press
the crumbs
down. Fry them of a delicate brown in
fresh lard or butter, and be careful not
to burn them. They should be very
thoroughly done, but not dry. If the
cutlets be thick, keep the pan covered
for a few minutes at a good distance from
the fire, after they have acquired a good
colour: by this means, the meat will be
done through. Lay the cutlets in a dish,
keep them hot, and make a gravy in the
pan as follows:—Dredge in a little flour,
add a piece of butter the size of a walnut,
brown it, then pour as much boiling
water as is required over it, season with
pepper and salt, add a little lemon-juice,
give one boil, and pour it over the cutlets.
They should be garnished with
slices of broiled bacon, and a few forcemeat
balls will be found a very excellent
addition to this dish. <i>Time.</i>—For cutlets
of a moderate thickness, about 12
minutes; if very thick, allow more time.
<i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for
6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from March to
October.</p>

<div class="caption">VEAL CUTLETS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Veal cutlets may be merely
floured and fried of a nice brown: the
gravy and garnishing should be the same
as in the preceding recipe. They may
also be cut from the loin or neck, as
shown in the engraving.</p>


<h3>VEAL CUTLETS, Broiled, à la
Italienne (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Neck of veal, salt and
pepper to taste, the yolk of 1 egg, bread-crumbs,
½ pint of Italian sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the veal into cutlets, flatten and
trim them nicely; powder over them a
little salt and pepper; brush them over
with the yolk of an egg, dip them into
bread-crumbs, then into clarified butter,
and, afterwards, in the bread-crumbs
again; boil or fry them over a clear fire,
that they may acquire a good brown
colour. Arrange them in the dish alternately
with rashers of broiled ham, and
pour the sauce (made by recipe for Italian
sauce, <a href="#Page_305">p. 305</a>) in the middle. <i>Time.</i>—10
to 15 minutes, according to the thickness
of the cutlets. <i>Average cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb.
<i>Seasonable</i> from March to October.</p>


<h3>VEAL CUTLETS, à la Maintenon
(an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 or 3 lbs. of veal cutlets,
egg and bread-crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls
of minced savoury herbs, salt and pepper
to taste, a little grated nutmeg. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the cutlets about ¾ inch in thickness,
flatten them, and brush them over
with the yolk of an egg; dip them into
bread-crumbs and minced herbs, season
with pepper and salt and grated nutmeg,
and fold each cutlet in a piece of buttered
paper. Broil them, and send them to
table with melted butter or a good gravy.
<i>Time.</i>—From 15 to 18 minutes. <i>Average
cost</i>, 10<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6
persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from March to
October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Fillet of, au Béchamel
(Cold Meat Cookery).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A small fillet of veal, 1
pint of béchamel sauce, a few bread-crumbs,
clarified butter. <i>Mode.</i>—A fillet
of veal that has been roasted the preceding
day will answer very well for this
dish. Cut the middle out rather deep,
leaving a good margin round, from which
to cut nice slices, and if there should be
any cracks in the veal, fill them up with
forcemeat. Mince finely the meat that
was taken out, mixing with it a little of
the forcemeat to flavour, and stir to it
sufficient béchamel to make it of a
proper consistency. Warm the veal in
the oven for about an hour, taking care
to baste it well, that it may not be dry;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
put the mince in the place where the
meat was taken out, sprinkle a few
bread-crumbs over it, and drop a little
clarified butter on the bread-crumbs;
put it into the oven for ¼ hour to brown,
and pour béchamel round the sides of
the dish. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether 1½ hour.
<i>Seasonable</i> from March to October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Roast Fillet of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Veal, forcemeat, melted
butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Have the fillet cut according
to the size required; take out
the bone, and after raising the skin from
the meat, put under the flap a nice forcemeat.
Prepare sufficient of this, as there
should be some left to eat cold, and to
season and flavour a mince if required.
Skewer and bind the veal up in a
round form; dredge well with flour,
put it down at some distance from
the fire at first, and baste continually.
About ½ hour before serving, draw
it nearer the fire, that it may acquire
more colour, as the outside should be of
a rich brown, but not burnt. Dish it,
remove the skewers, which replace by a
silver one; pour over the joint some
good melted butter, and serve with
either boiled ham, bacon, or pickled pork.
Never omit to send a cut lemon to table
with roast veal. <i>Time.</i>—A fillet of veal
weighing 12 lbs., about 4 hours. <i>Average
cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 9 or
10 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from March to
October.</p>

<div class="caption">FILLET OF VEAL.</div>
</div>


<h3>VEAL, Fillet of.</h3>

<p>The carving of this joint is similar to
that of a round of beef. Slices, not too
thick, in the
direction of the
line 1 to 2 are
cut; and the
only point to be
careful about is,
that the veal be
<i>evenly</i> carved.
Between the flap
and the meat the stuffing is inserted, and
a small portion of this should be served
to every guest. The persons whom the
host wishes most to honour should be
asked if they like the delicious brown
outside slice, as this, by many, is exceedingly
relished.</p>

<h3>VEAL, Stewed Fillet of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A small fillet of veal,
forcemeat, thickening of butter and flour,
a few mushrooms, white pepper to taste,
2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, 2 blades
of pounded mace, ½ glass of sherry.
<i>Mode.</i>—If the whole of the leg is purchased,
take off the knuckle to stew, and
also the square end, which will serve for
cutlets or pies. Remove the bone, and
fill the space with a forcemeat. Roll and
skewer it up firmly; place a few skewers
at the bottom of a stewpan to prevent
the meat from sticking, and cover the
veal with a little weak stock. Let it
simmer very <i>gently</i> until tender, as the
more slowly veal is stewed, the better.
Strain and thicken the sauce, flavour it
with lemon-juice, mace, sherry, and white
pepper; give one boil, and pour it over
the meat. The skewers should be removed,
and replaced by a silver one, and
the dish garnished with slices of cut
lemon. <i>Time.</i>—A fillet of veal weighing
6 lbs., 3 hours’ very gentle stewing.
<i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for
5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> from March
to October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Fricandeau of (an Entrée).</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/illus-355c.jpg" width="280" height="168" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">FRICANDEAU OF VEAL.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A piece of the fat side of
a leg of veal (about 3 lbs.), lardoons,
2 carrots, 2 large onions, a faggot of
savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded
mace, 6 whole allspice, 2 bay-leaves,
pepper to taste, a few slices of fat bacon,
1 pint of stock. <i>Mode.</i>—The veal for a
fricandeau should be of the best quality,
or it will not be good. It may be known
by the meat being white and not thready.
Take off the skin, flatten the veal on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
table, then at one stroke of the knife,
cut off as much as is required, for a
fricandeau with an uneven surface never
looks well. Trim it, and with a sharp
knife make two or three slits in the
middle, that it may taste more of the
seasoning. Now lard it thickly with fat
bacon, as lean gives a red colour to the
fricandeau. Slice the vegetables, and
put these, with the herbs and spices,
in the <i>middle</i> of a stewpan, with a few
slices of bacon at the top: these should
form a sort of mound in the centre for
the veal to rest upon. Lay the fricandeau
over the bacon, sprinkle over it a
little salt, and pour in just sufficient stock
to cover the bacon, &amp;c., without touching
the veal. Let it gradually come to a
boil; then put it over a slow and equal
fire, and let it <i>simmer very</i> gently for
about 2½ hours, or longer should it be
very large. Baste it frequently with the
liquor, and a short time before serving,
put it into a brisk oven, to make the
bacon firm, which otherwise would break
when it was glazed. Dish the fricandeau,
keep it hot, skim off the fat from the
liquor, and reduce it quickly to a glaze,
with which glaze the fricandeau, and
serve with a purée of whatever vegetable
happens to be in season—spinach, sorrel,
asparagus, cucumbers, peas, &amp;c. <i>Time.</i>—2½
hours. If very large, allow more
time. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for an entrée. <i>Seasonable</i> from March to
October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Fricandeau of (more economical).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The best end of a neck
of veal (about 2½ lbs.), lardoons, 2 carrots,
2 onions, a faggot of savoury herbs,
2 blades of mace, 2 bay-leaves, a little
whole white pepper, a few slices of fat
bacon. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut away the lean part
of the best end of a neck of veal with a
sharp knife, scooping it from the bones.
Put the bones in with a little water,
which will serve to moisten the fricandeau;
they should stew about 1½ hour.
Lard the veal, proceed in the same way
as in the preceding recipe, and be careful
that the gravy does not touch the
fricandeau. Stew very gently for 3
hours; glaze, and serve it on sorrel,
spinach, or with a little gravy in the
dish. <i>Time.</i>—3 hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for an entrée. <i>Seasonable</i>
from March to October.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When the prime part of the
leg is cut off, it spoils the whole; consequently,
to use this for a fricandeau
is rather extravagant. The best end of
the neck answers the purpose nearly or
quite as well.</p>


<h3>VEAL, to Carve a Knuckle of.</h3>

<p>The engraving, showing the dotted
line from 1 to 2,
sufficiently indicates
the direction
which
should be given
to the knife in
carving this dish.
The best slices
are those from
the thickest part
of the knuckle, that is, outside the line
1 to 2.</p>

<div class="caption">KNUCKLE OF VEAL.</div>
</div>


<h3>VEAL, to Ragoût a Knuckle of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Knuckle of veal, pepper
and salt to taste, flour, 1 onion, 1 head of
celery, or a little celery-seed, a faggot of
savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace,
thickening of butter and flour, a few
young carrots, 1 tablespoonful of tomato
sauce, 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry, the
juice of ½ lemon. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the meat
from a knuckle of veal into neat slices,
season with pepper and salt, and dredge
them with flour. Fry them in a little
butter of a pale brown, and put them
into a stewpan with the bone (which
should be chopped in several places);
add the celery, herbs, mace, and carrots;
pour over all about 1 pint of hot water,
and let it simmer very gently for 2 hours
over a slow but clear fire. Take out the
slices of meat and carrots, strain and
thicken the gravy with a little butter
rolled in flour; add the remaining ingredients,
give one boil, put back the meat
and carrots, let these get hot through,
and serve. When in season, a few green
peas, <i>boiled separately</i>, and added to this
dish at the moment of serving, would be
found a very agreeable addition. <i>Time.</i>—2
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> per
lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Stewed Knuckle of, and
Rice.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Knuckle of veal, 1 onion,
2 blades of mace, 1 teaspoonful of salt,
½ lb. of rice. <i>Mode.</i>—Have the knuckle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
cut small, or cut some cutlets from it,
that it may be just large enough to be
eaten the same day it is dressed, as cold
boiled veal is not a particularly tempting
dish. Break the shank-bone, wash it
clean, and put the meat into a stewpan
with sufficient water to cover it. Let
it gradually come to a boil, put in the
salt, and remove the scum as fast as it
rises. When it has simmered gently for
about ¾ hour, add the remaining ingredients,
and stew the whole gently for
2¼ hours. Put the meat into a deep
dish, pour over it the rice, &amp;c., and send
boiled bacon, and a tureen of parsley
and butter to table with it. <i>Time.</i>—A
knuckle of veal weighing 6 lbs., 3 hours’
gentle stewing. <i>Average cost</i>, 5<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>
per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from March to October.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—Macaroni, instead of rice,
boiled with the veal, will be found good;
or the rice and macaroni may be omitted,
and the veal sent to table smothered
in parsley and butter.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Roast Loin of.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Veal; melted butter.
<i>Mode.</i>—Paper the kidney fat; roll in
and skewer the flap, which makes the
joint a good shape; dredge it well with
flour, and put it down to a bright fire.
Should the loin be very large, skewer
the kidney back for a time to roast
thoroughly. Keep it well basted, and a
short time before serving, remove the
paper from the kidney, and allow it to
acquire a nice brown colour, but it should
not be burnt. Have ready some melted
butter, put it into the dripping-pan after
it is emptied of its contents, pour it over
the veal, and serve. Garnish the dish
with slices of lemon and forcemeat balls,
and send to table with it boiled bacon,
ham, pickled pork, or pig’s cheek. <i>Time.</i>—A
large loin, 3 hours. <i>Average cost</i>,
9½<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8 persons.
<i>Seasonable</i> from March to October.</p>

placed under the kidneys when the veal
is dished.</p>


<h3>VEAL,  Loin of, au Béchamel
(Cold Meat Cookery).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Loin of veal, ½ teaspoonful
of minced lemon-peel, rather more
than ½ pint of béchamel or white sauce,
<i>Mode.</i>—A loin of veal which has come
from table with very little taken off,
answers well for this dish. Cut off
the meat from the inside, mince it, and
mix with it some minced lemon-peel;
put it into sufficient béchamel to warm
it through. In the mean time, wrap
the joint in buttered paper, and place it
in the oven to warm. When thoroughly
hot, dish the mince, place the loin above
it, and pour over the remainder of the
béchamel. <i>Time.</i>—1½ hour to warm the
meat in the oven. <i>Seasonable</i> from March
to October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Loin of, à la Daube.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The chump end of a loin
of veal, forcemeat, a few slices of bacon,
a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 blades of
mace, ½ teaspoonful of whole white
pepper, 1 pint of veal stock or water,
5 or 6 green onions. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut off
the chump from a loin of veal, and take
out the bone; fill the cavity with forcemeat,
tie it up tightly, and lay it in
a stewpan with the bones and trimmings,
and cover the veal with a few slices of
bacon. Add the herbs, mace, pepper,
and onions, and stock or water; cover
the pan with a closely-fitting lid, and
simmer for 2 hours, shaking the stewpan
occasionally. Take out the bacon, herbs,
and onions; reduce the gravy, if not
already thick enough, to a glaze, with
which glaze the meat, and serve with
tomato, mushroom, or sorrel sauce.
<i>Time.</i>—2 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per
lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4 or 5 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
from March to October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, to Carve Loin of.</h3>

<p>As is the case with a loin of mutton,
the careful jointing of a loin of veal is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
more than half the battle in carving
it.  If the butcher be negligent in
this matter, he should be admonished;
for there is
nothing more
annoying or irritating
to an
inexperienced
carver than to
be obliged to
turn his knife
in all directions
to find the exact place where it should
be inserted in order to divide the bones.
When the jointing is properly performed,
there is little difficulty in carrying the
knife down in the direction of the line
1 to 2. To each guest should be given
a piece of the kidney and kidney fat,
which lie underneath, and are considered
great delicacies.</p>

<h3>VEAL, Minced, with Béchamel
Sauce (Cold Meat Cookery, very
good).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of a fillet of
veal, 1 pint of béchamel sauce, ½ teaspoonful
of minced lemon-peel, forcemeat
balls. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut—but do not
<i>chop</i>—a few slices of cold roast veal as
finely as possible, sufficient to make
rather more than 1 lb., weighed after
being minced. Make the above proportion
of béchamel, by recipe; add the
lemon-peel, put in the veal, and let
the whole gradually warm through.
When it is at the point of simmering,
dish it, and garnish with forcemeat
balls and fried sippets of bread. <i>Time.</i>—To
simmer 1 minute. <i>Average cost</i>,
exclusive of the cold meat, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>

<h3>VEAL, Minced (more economical).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of cold
roast fillet or loin of veal, rather more
than 1 pint of water, 1 onion, ½ teaspoonful
of minced lemon-peel, salt and
white pepper to taste, 1 blade of pounded
mace, 2 or 3 young carrots, a faggot of
sweet herbs, thickening of butter and
flour, a tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 3
tablespoonfuls of cream or milk. <i>Mode.</i>—Take
about 1 lb. of veal, and should
there be any bones, dredge them with
flour, and put them into a stewpan with
the brown outside, and a few meat trimmings,
add rather more than a pint of
water, the onion cut in slices, lemon-peel,
seasoning, mace, carrots, and
herbs; simmer these well for rather
more than 1 hour, and strain the liquor.
Rub a little flour into some butter; add
this to the gravy, set it on the fire, and,
when it boils, skim well. Mince the veal
finely by <i>cutting</i>, and not chopping it;
put it in the gravy; let it get warmed
through gradually; add the lemon-juice
and cream, and, when it is on the point
of boiling, serve. Garnish the dish with
sippets of toasted bread and slices of
bacon rolled and toasted. Forcemeat
balls may also be added. If more
lemon-peel is liked than is stated above,
put a little very finely minced to the veal,
after it is warmed in the gravy. <i>Time.</i>—1
hour to make the gravy. <i>Average
cost</i>, exclusive of the cold meat, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
from March to October.</p>


<h3>VEAL, Minced, and Macaroni (a
pretty side or corner dish).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ lb. of minced cold roast
veal, 3 oz. of ham, 1 tablespoonful of
gravy, pepper and salt to taste, ¼ teaspoonful
of grated nutmeg, ¼ lb. of
bread-crumbs, ¼ lb. of macaroni, 1 or 2
eggs to bind, a small piece of butter.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut some nice slices from a cold
fillet of veal, trim off the brown outside,
and mince the meat finely with the above
proportion of ham: should the meat be
very dry, add a spoonful of good gravy.
Season highly with pepper and salt, add
the grated nutmeg and bread-crumbs,
and mix these ingredients with 1 or 2
eggs well beaten, which should bind the
mixture and make it like forcemeat. In
the mean time, boil the macaroni in salt
and water, and drain it; butter a mould,
put some of the macaroni at the bottom
and sides of it, in whatever form is liked;
mix the remainder with the forcemeat,
fill the mould up to the top, put a plate
or small dish on it, and steam for ½ hour.
Turn it out carefully, and serve with good
gravy poured round, but not over, the
meat. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour. <i>Average cost</i>,
exclusive of the cold meat, 10<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i>
from March to October.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—To make a variety, boil some
carrots and turnips separately in a little
salt and water; when done, cut them
into pieces about ⅛ inch in thickness;
butter an oval mould, and place these in
it, in white and red stripes alternately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
at the bottom and sides. Proceed as
in the foregoing recipe, and be very
careful in turning it out of the mould.</p>

fine, salt, pepper, and pounded mace to
taste, a slice of toast soaked in milk,
1 egg. <i>Mode.</i>—Mince the meat very
fine, after removing from it all skin and
outside pieces, and chop the bacon;
mix these well together, adding the
lemon-peel, onion, seasoning, mace, and
toast. When all the ingredients are
thoroughly incorporated, beat up an egg,
with which bind the mixture. Butter a
shape, put in the meat, and bake for ¾
hour; turn it out of the mould carefully,
and pour round it a good brown gravy.
A sheep’s head dressed in this manner is
an economical and savoury dish. <i>Time.</i>—¾
hour. <i>Average</i> cost, exclusive of the
meat, 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> from March to
October.</p>

with water. Stew it gently for 2 hours,
or until it is quite tender; strain off the
liquor; stir together over the fire, in a
stewpan, a little flour and butter until
brown; lay the veal in this, the upper
side to the bottom of the pan, and let
it remain till it is a nice brown colour.
Place it in the dish; pour into the stewpan
as much gravy as is required, boil it
up, skim well, add the wine, pounded
mace, and lemon-juice; simmer for 3

fillet of veal, a few thin slices of bacon,
forcemeat, a cupful of gravy, 4 tablespoonfuls
of cream, puff-crust. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
thin slices from a fillet of veal,
place on them thin slices of bacon, and
over them a layer of forcemeat, made by
recipe, with an additional seasoning of
shalot and cayenne; roll them tightly,
and fill up a pie-dish with them; add the
gravy and cream, cover with a puff-crust,
and bake for 1 to 1½ hour: should
the pie be very large, allow 2 hours.
The pieces of rolled veal should be about
3 inches in length, and about 3 inches
round. <i>Time.</i>—Moderate-sized pie, 1 to
1½ hour. <i>Seasonable</i> from March to
October.</p>


<h3>VEAL PIE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 lbs. of veal cutlets, 1
or 2 slices of lean bacon or ham, pepper
and salt to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of
minced savoury herbs, 2 blades of
pounded mace, crust, 1 teacupful of
gravy. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut the cutlets into
square pieces, and season them with
pepper, salt, and pounded mace; put
them in a pie-dish with the savoury
herbs sprinkled over, and 1 or 2 slices of
lean bacon or ham placed at the top:
if possible, this should be previously
cooked, as undressed bacon makes the
veal red, and spoils its appearance. Pour
in a little water, cover with crust, ornament
it in any way that is approved;
brush it over with the yolk of an egg,
and bake in a well-heated oven for about
1½ hour. Pour in a good gravy after
baking, which is done by removing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>

lemon-peel finely minced, the yolks of 2
hard-boiled eggs, ½ pint of water, nearly
½ pint of good strong gravy, puff-crust.
<i>Mode.</i>—Cut the veal into nice square
pieces, and put a layer of them at the
bottom of a pie-dish; sprinkle over these
a portion of the herbs, spices, seasoning,
lemon-peel, and the yolks of the eggs cut
in slices; cut the ham very thin, and put
a layer of this in. Proceed in this
manner until the dish is full, so arranging
it that the ham comes at the top. Lay a
puff paste on the edge of the dish, and
pour in about ½ pint of water; cover with
crust, ornament it with leaves, brush it
over with the yolk of an egg, and bake in
a well-heated oven for 1 to 1½ hour, or
longer, should the pie be very large.
When it is taken out of the oven, pour in
at the top, through a funnel, nearly ½ pint
of strong gravy: this should be made sufficiently
good that, when cold, it may cut
in a firm jelly. This pie may be very
much enriched by adding a few mushrooms,
oysters, or sweetbreads; but it
will be found very good without any of
the last-named additions. <i>Time.</i>—1½
hour, or longer, should the pie be very
large. <i>Average cost</i>, 3<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 5

butter and flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Bone the joint
by carefully detaching the meat from
the blade-bone on one side, and then on

the skin; then cut the bone from the
knuckle, and take it out. Fill the cavity
whence the bone was taken with
a forcemeat. Roll and bind the veal up
tightly; put it into a stewpan with the
carrots, onions, seasoning, herbs, and
mace; pour in just sufficient water to
cover it, and let it stew <i>very gently</i> for
about 5 hours. Before taking it up, try
if it is properly done by thrusting a
larding-needle in it: if it penetrates
easily, it is sufficiently cooked. Strain
and skim the gravy, thicken with butter
and flour, give one boil, and pour it

brown colour. Put the meat into a
stewpan with the carrots, onions, potatoes,
herbs, pepper, and salt; pour over
it sufficient boiling water to cover it, and
stew gently for 2 hours. Take out the
meat and herbs, put it in a deep dish,
skim off all the fat from the gravy, and
flavour it with lemon-juice, tomato
sauce, and mushroom ketchup, in the
above proportion. Have ready a pint of
green peas boiled <i>separately</i>; put these
with the meat, pour over it the gravy,
and serve. The dish may be garnished
with a few forcemeat balls. The meat,
when preferred, may be cut into chops,
and floured and fried instead of being
roasted; and any part of veal dressed in
this way will be found extremely savoury
and good. <i>Time.</i>—3 hours.
<i>Average cost</i>, 9<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 6
or 7 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>, with peas,

table with them a tureen of molted
butter, or, in lieu of this, a small pat of
salt butter. Large vegetable marrows
may be preserved throughout the winter
by storing them in a dry place; when
wanted for use, a few slices should be
cut and boiled in the same manner as
above; but, when once begun, the marrow
must be eaten quickly, as it keeps
but a short time after it is cut. Vegetable
marrows are also very delicious
mashed: they should be boiled, then
drained, and mashed smoothly with a
wooden spoon. Heat them in a saucepan,
add a seasoning of salt and pepper,
and a small piece of butter, and dish
with a few sippets of toasted broad
placed round as a garnish. <i>Time.</i>—Young

the onions, carrots, and turnips; wash
and drain them well, and put them in
the stewpan with the butter and powdered
sugar. Toss the whole over a
sharp fire for 10 minutes, but do not let
them brown, or you will spoil the flavour
of the soup. When done, pour the
stock or boiling water on them; add the
bread, celery, herbs, and seasoning;
stew for 3 hours; skim well and strain
it off. When ready to serve, add a

them up into small pieces; toast the
bread rather brown, and put all into
a stewpan with the water and seasoning.
Simmer gently for 3 hours, or until all is
reduced to a pulp, and pass it through a
sieve in the same way as pea-soup,
which it should resemble in consistence;
but it should be a dark brown colour.
Warm it up again when required; put
in the Harvey’s sauce, and, if necessary,
add to the flavouring. <i>Time.</i>—3 hours,
or rather more. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>d.</i> per
quart. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time. <i>Sufficient</i>

<h3>VEGETABLES, Cut for Soups, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>The annexed engraving represents a
cutter for shaping vegetables for soups,
ragoûts, stews,
&amp;c.; carrots and
turnips being the
usual vegetables
for which this
utensil is used.
Cut the vegetables
into slices about
¼ inch in thickness,
stamp them
out with the
cutter, and boil them for a few minutes
in salt and water, until tender. Turnips
should be cut in rather thicker slices
than carrots, on account of the former
boiling more quickly to a pulp than the
latter.</p>

<h3>VENISON, Hashed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The remains of roast
venison, its own or mutton gravy,
thickening of butter and flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Cut
the meat from the bones in neat
slices, and, if there is sufficient of its
own gravy left, put the meat into this,
as it is preferable to any other. Should
there not be enough, put the bones and
trimmings into a stewpan, with about a
pint of mutton gravy; let them stew
gently for an hour, and strain the gravy.
Put a little flour and butter into the
stewpan, keep stirring until brown, then
add the strained gravy, and give it a
boil up; skim and strain again, and,
when a little cool, put in the slices of
venison. Place the stewpan by the side
of the fire, and, when on the point of
simmering, serve: do not allow it to
boil, or the meat will be hard. Send
red-currant jelly to table with it. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether,
1½ hour. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Buck
venison, from June to Michaelmas;
doe venison, from November to the end
of January.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—A small quantity of Harvey’s
sauce, ketchup, or port wine, may be
added to enrich the gravy: these ingredients
must, however, be used very sparingly,
or they will overpower the flavour
of the venison.</p>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Venison, coarse flour-and-water
paste, a little flour. <i>Mode.</i>—Choose
a haunch with clear, bright, and
thick fat, and the cleft of the hoof smooth
and close; the greater quantity of fat
there is, the better quality will the meat
be. As many people object to venison
when it has too much <i>haut goût</i>, ascertain
how long it has been kept, by running
a sharp skewer into the meat close
to the bone: when this is withdrawn, its
sweetness can be judged of. With care
and attention, it will keep good a fortnight,
unless the weather is very mild.
Keep it perfectly dry by wiping it
with clean cloths till not the least
damp remains, and sprinkle over powdered
ginger or pepper, as a preventive
against the fly. When required for use,
wash it in warm water, and <i>dry</i> it <i>well</i>
with a cloth; butter a sheet of white
paper, put it over the fat, lay a coarse
paste, about ½ inch in thickness, over
this, and then a sheet or two of strong
paper. Tie the whole firmly on to the
haunch with twine, and put the joint
down to a strong close fire; baste the
venison immediately, to prevent the
paper and string from burning, and continue
this operation, without intermission,
the whole of the time it is cooking.
About 20 minutes before it is done, carefully
remove the paste and paper, dredge
the joint with flour, and baste well with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
<i>butter</i> until it is nicely frothed, and of a
nice pale-brown colour; garnish the
knuckle-bone with a frill of white paper,
and serve with a good, strong, but unflavoured
gravy, in a tureen, and currant
jelly; or melt the jelly with a little port,
wine, and serve that also in a tureen.
As the principal object in roasting venison
is to preserve the fat, the above is
the best mode of doing so where expense
is not objected to; but, in ordinary
cases, the paste may be dispensed with,
and a double paper placed over the roast
instead: it will not require so long
cooking without the paste. Do not
omit to send very hot plates to table, as
the venison fat so soon freezes: to be
thoroughly enjoyed by epicures, it
should be eaten on hot-water plates.
The neck and shoulder may be roasted
in the same manner. <i>Time.</i>—A large
haunch of buck venison, with the paste,
4 to 5 hours; haunch of doe venison, 3¼
to 3¾ hours. Allow less time without
the paste. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 18 persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Buck
venison in greatest perfection
from June to Michaelmas; doe
venison from November to the end of
January.</p>


<h3>VENISON, to Carve Haunch of.</h3>

<p>Here is a grand dish for a knight of
the carving-knife to exercise his skill
upon, and, what will be pleasant for
many to know, there is but little difficulty
in the performance. An incision
being made completely down to the
bone, in the direction of the line 1 to 2,
the gravy will then be able easily to flow;
when slices, not too thick, should be cut
along the haunch, as indicated by the
line 4 to 3; that end of the joint marked
3 having been turned towards the carver,
so that he may have a more complete
command over the joint. Although
some epicures affect to believe that some
parts of the haunch are superior to
others, yet we doubt if there is any
difference between the slices cut above
and below the line. It should be borne
in mind to serve each guest with a portion
of fat; and the most expeditious
carver will be the best carver, as, like
mutton, venison soon begins to chill,
when it loses much of its charm.</p>

<h3>VENISON, Stewed.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A shoulder of venison, a
few slices of mutton fat, 2 glasses of
port wine, pepper and allspice to taste,
1½ pint of weak stock or gravy, ½ teaspoonful
of whole pepper, ½ teaspoonful
of whole allspice. <i>Mode.</i>—Hang the
venison till tender; take out the bone,
flatten the meat with a rolling-pin, and

the bone and the above proportion of
weak stock or gravy, whole allspice,
black pepper, and port wine; cover the
lid down closely, and simmer, very
gently, from 3½ to 4 hours. When quite
tender, take off the tape, and dish the
meat; strain the gravy over it, and send
it to table with red currant jelly. Unless
the joint is very fat, the above is
the best mode of cooking it. <i>Time.</i>—3½
to 4 hours. <i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per lb. <i>Sufficient</i> for 10 or 12
persons. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Buck venison,

<h3>VERMICELLI PUDDING.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—4 oz. of vermicelli, 1½
pint of milk, ½ pint of cream, 3 oz. of
butter, 3 oz. of sugar, 4 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil
the vermicelli in the milk until it is
tender; then stir in the remaining ingredients,
omitting the cream, if not obtainable.
Flavour the mixture with grated
lemon-rind, essence of bitter almonds,
or vanilla; butter a pie-dish; line the
edges with puff-paste, put in the pudding,
and bake in a moderate oven for
about ¾ hour. <i>Time.</i>—¾ hour. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> without cream. <i>Sufficient</i>
for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i> at
any time.</p>


<h3>VERMICELLI SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of bacon, stuck
with cloves; ½ oz. of butter, worked up
in flour; 1 small fowl, trussed for boiling;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
2 oz. of vermicelli, 2 quarts of
white stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the stock,
bacon, butter, and fowl, into the stewpan,
and stew for ¾ of an hour. Take
the vermicelli, add it to a little of the
stock, and set it on the fire, till it is
quite tender. When the soup is ready,
take out the fowl and bacon, and put
the bacon on a dish. Skim the soup as
clean as possible; pour it, with the vermicelli,
over the fowl. Cut some bread
thin, put in the soup, and serve. <i>Time.</i>—2
hours. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of
the fowl and bacon, 10<i>d.</i> per quart.
<i>Seasonable</i> in winter. <i>Sufficient</i> for 4
persons.</p>


<h3>VERMICELLI SOUP.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¼ lb. of vermicelli, 2
quarts of clear gravy stock. <i>Mode.</i>—Put
the vermicelli in the soup, boiling;
simmer very gently for ½ an hour, and
stir frequently. <i>Time.</i>—½ an hour.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per quart. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year. <i>Sufficient</i> for 8
persons.</p>


<h3>VOL-AU-VENT (an Entrée).</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ to 1 lb. of puff-paste,
fricasseed chickens, rabbits, ragoûts, or
the remains of cold fish, flaked and
warmed in thick white sauce. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
from ¾ to 1 lb. of puff-paste,
taking care that it is very evenly rolled
out each time, to ensure its rising properly;
and if the paste is not extremely
light, and put into a good hot oven, this
cannot be accomplished, and the <i>vol-au-vent</i>
will look very badly. Roll out the
paste to the thickness of about 1½ inch,
and, with a
fluted cutter,
stamp it out
to the desired
shape, either
round or oval,
and, with the
point of a small
knife, make a
slight incision in the paste all round the
top, about an inch from the edge, which,
when baked, forms the lid. Put the
<i>vol-au-vent</i> into a good brisk oven, and
keep the door shut for a few minutes
after it is put in. Particular attention
should be paid to the heating of the
oven, for the paste <i>cannot</i> rise without a
tolerable degree of heat. When of a
nice colour, without being scorched,
withdraw it from the oven, instantly
remove the cover where it was marked,
and detach all the soft crumb from the
centre: in doing this, be careful not to
break the edges of the <i>vol-au-vent</i>; but
should they look thin in places, stop
them with small flakes of the inside
paste, stuck on with the white of an egg.
This precaution is necessary to prevent
the fricassee or ragoût from bursting the
case, and so spoiling the appearance of
the dish. Fill the <i>vol-au-vent</i> with a
rich mince, or fricassee, or ragoût, or the
remains of cold fish flaked and warmed
in a good white sauce, and do not make
them very liquid, for fear of the gravy
bursting the crust: replace the lid, and
serve. To improve the appearance of
the crust, brush it over with the yolk
of an egg <i>after</i> it has risen properly.
<i>Time.</i>—¾ hour to bake the <i>vol-au-vent</i>.
<i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of the interior,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>

<h3>VOL-AU-VENT OF FRESH
STRAWBERRIES, WITH
WHIPPED CREAM.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ lb. of puff-paste, 1
pint of freshly-gathered strawberries,
sugar to taste, a plateful of whipped
cream. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a <i>vol-au-vent</i> case,
only not quite so large nor so high as for
a savoury one. When nearly done,
brush the paste over with the white of
an egg, then sprinkle on it some pounded
sugar, and put it back in the oven to set
the glaze. Remove the interior, or soft
crumb, and, at the moment of serving,
fill it with the strawberries, which should
be picked, and broken up with sufficient
sugar to sweeten them nicely. Place a
few spoonfuls of whipped cream on the
top and serve. <i>Time.</i>—½ hour to 40
minutes to bake the <i>vol-au-vent</i>. <i>Average
cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 <i>vol-au-vent</i>.
<i>Seasonable</i> in June and July.</p>

<h3>VOL-AU-VENT, Sweet, of Plums,
Apples, or any other Fresh
Fruit.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—¾ lb. of puff-paste, about
1 pint of fruit compôte. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
½ lb. of puff-paste, taking care to bake
it in a good brisk oven, to draw it up
nicely and make it look light. Have
ready sufficient stewed fruit, the syrup
of which must be boiled down until very
thick; fill the <i>vol-au-vent</i> with this, and
pile it high in the centre; powder a little
sugar over it, and put it back in the
oven to glaze, or use a salamander for
the purpose: the <i>vol-au-vent</i> is then
ready to serve. It may be made with
any fruit that is in season, such as
rhubarb, oranges, gooseberries, currants,
cherries, apples, &amp;c.; but care must be
taken not to have the syrup too thin, for
fear of its breaking through the crust.
<i>Time.</i>—½ hour to 40 minutes to bake the
<i>vol-au-vent</i>. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of
the compôte, 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 1 entremets.</p>


<h3>WAFERS, Geneva.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 eggs, 3 oz. butter, 3 oz.
flour, 3 oz. pounded sugar. <i>Mode.</i>—Well
whisk the eggs; put them into a basin,
and stir to them the butter, which should
be beaten to a cream; add the flour and
sifted sugar gradually, and then mix all
well together. Butter a baking-sheet,
and drop on it a teaspoonful of the
mixture at a time, leaving a space between
each. Bake in a cool oven; watch
the pieces of paste, and, when half done,
roll them up like wafers, and put in a
small wedge of bread or piece of wood,
to keep them in shape. Return them
to the oven until crisp. Before serving,
remove the bread, put a spoonful of
preserve in the widest end, and fill up
with whipped cream. This is a very
pretty and ornamental dish for the
supper-table, and is very nice and easily
made. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether from 20 to
25 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, exclusive of
the preserve and cream, 7<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for a nice-sized dish. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>

allow 1 teaspoonful of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—Place
the walnuts in the salt and water
for 24 hours at least; then take them
out, and rub them dry. Old nuts may
be freshened in this manner; or walnuts,
when first picked, may be put into
an earthen pan with salt sprinkled
amongst them, and with damped hay
placed on the top of them, and then
covered down with a lid. They must
be well wiped before they are put on

brine of salt and water (4 lbs. of salt to
each gallon of water), into which put
the walnuts, letting them remain 9 days,
and changing the brine every third day;
drain them off, put them on a dish,
place it in the sun until they become
perfectly black, which will be in 2 or 3
days; have ready dry jars, into which
place the walnuts, and do not quite fill
the jars. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover
them, for 10 minutes, with spices in the
above proportion, and pour it hot over
the walnuts, which must be quite covered
with the pickle; tie down with
bladder, and keep in a dry place.

before the walnuts harden.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—When liked, a few shalots may
be added to the vinegar, and boiled
with it.</p>


<h3>WATER SOUCHY.</h3>

<p>Perch, tench, soles, eels, and flounders
are considered the best fish for this dish.
For the souchy, put some water into a
stewpan with a bunch of chopped parsley,
some roots, and sufficient salt to
make it brackish. Let these simmer for
1 hour, and then stew the fish in this
water. When they are done, take them
out to drain, have ready some finely-chopped
parsley, and a few roots cut
into slices of about one inch thick and
an inch in length. Put the fish in a
tureen or deep dish, strain the liquor
over them, and add the minced parsley

and let it stand 12 hours longer; then
bottle, and cork well. <i>Time.</i>—To stand
24 hours before being strained; 12 hours
after the sugar is added. <i>Seasonable.</i>—Make
this in July.</p>


<h3>WHITEBAIT, to Dress.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A little flour, hot lard,
seasoning of salt. <i>Mode.</i>—This fish
should be put into iced water as soon as
bought, unless they are cooked immediately.
Drain them from the water in
a colander, and have ready a nice clean
dry cloth, over which put 2 good handfuls
of flour. Toss in the whitebait,
shake them lightly in the cloth, and
put them in a wicker-sieve to take away
the superfluous flour. Throw them into
a pan of boiling lard, very few at a time,
and let them fry till of a whitey-brown
colour. Directly they are done, they
must be taken out, and laid before the
fire for a minute or two on a sieve reversed,
covered with blotting-paper to
absorb the fat. Dish them on a hot
napkin, arrange the fish very high in the
centre, and sprinkle a little salt over the
whole. <i>Time.</i>—3 minutes. <i>Seasonable</i>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Salt and water; flour.
<i>Mode.</i>—Wash the whiting in salt and
water, wipe them thoroughly, and let
them remain in the cloth to absorb all
moisture. Flour them well, and broil
over a very clear fire. Serve with <i>maître
d’hôtel</i> sauce, or plain melted butter (<i>see</i>
<a href="#SAUCES">Sauces</a>). Be careful to preserve the
liver, as by some it is considered very

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Egg and bread-crumbs,
a little flour, hot lard, or clarified dripping.
<i>Mode.</i>—Take off the skin, clean,
and thoroughly wipe the fish free from
all moisture, as this is most essential, in
order that the egg and bread-crumbs
may properly adhere. Fasten the tail in
the mouth by means of a small skewer,
brush the fish over with egg, dredge
with a little flour, and cover with bread-crumbs.

bread-crumbs. <i>Mode.</i>—Grease the bottom
of a baking-dish with butter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
over it strew some minced parsley and
mushrooms. Scale, empty, and wash
the whitings, and wipe them thoroughly
dry, carefully preserving the livers. Lay
them in the dish, sprinkle them with
bread-crumbs and seasoning, adding a
little grated nutmeg, and also a little
more minced parsley and mushrooms.
Place small pieces of butter over the
whiting, moisten with the wine, and bake
for 20 minutes in a hot oven. If there
should be too much sauce, reduce it by
boiling over a sharp fire for a few minutes,
and pour under the fish. Serve with a
cut lemon, and no other sauce. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> each.
<i>Seasonable</i> all the year, but best from
October to March. <i>Sufficient.</i>—This
quantity for 4 or 5 persons.</p>


<h3>WHITING AUX FINES
HERBES.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 bunch of sweet herbs
chopped very fine; butter. <i>Mode.</i>—Clean
and skin the fish, fasten the tails
in the mouths, and lay them in a baking-dish.
Mince the herbs very fine, strew
them over the fish, and place small pieces
of butter over; cover with another dish,
and let them simmer in a Dutch oven
for ¼ hour or 20 minutes. Turn the fish
once or twice, and serve with the sauce
poured over. <i>Time.</i>—¼ hour or 20 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i> each. <i>Seasonable</i>
all the year, but best from October
to March. <i>Sufficient.</i>—1 small whiting
for each person.</p>


<h3>WIDGEON, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Widgeons, a little flour,
butter. <i>Mode.</i>—These are trussed in
the same manner as wild duck, but must
not be kept so long before they are
dressed. Put them down to a brisk fire;
flour, and baste them continually with
butter, and, when browned and nicely
frothed, send them to table hot and
quickly. Serve with brown gravy, or
orange gravy, and a cut lemon. <i>Time.</i>—¼
hour; if liked well done, 20 minutes.
<i>Average cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> each: but seldom
bought. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2 for a dish. <i>Seasonable</i>
from October to February.</p>


<h3>WIDGEON.</h3>

<p>Widgeon may be carved in the same
way as described in regard to wild
duck.</p>


<h3>WINE OR BRANDY SAUCE
FOR PUDDINGS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1 pint of melted butter,
3 heaped teaspoonfuls of pounded sugar;
1 <i>large</i> wineglassful of port or sherry, or
¾ of a <i>small</i> glassful of brandy. <i>Mode.</i>—Make
½ pint of melted butter, omitting
the salt; then stir in the sugar and
wine or spirit in the above proportion,
and bring the sauce to the point of
boiling. Serve in a boat or tureen separately,
and, if liked, pour a little of it
over the pudding. To convert this into
punch sauce, add to the sherry and
brandy a small wineglassful of rum and
the juice and grated rind of ½ lemon.
Liqueurs, such as Maraschino or Curaçoa,
substituted for the brandy, make excellent
sauces. <i>Time.</i>—Altogether, 15
minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 8<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i>
for 6 or 7 persons.</p>


<h3>WINE SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ pint of sherry, ¼ pint
of water, the yolks of 5 eggs, 2 oz. of
pounded sugar, ½ teaspoonful of minced
lemon-peel, a few pieces of candied citron
cut thin. <i>Mode.</i>—Separate the yolks
from the whites of 5 eggs; beat them,
and put them into a very clean saucepan
(if at hand, a lined one is best); add all
the other ingredients, place them over a
sharp fire, and keep stirring until the
sauce begins to thicken; then take it
off and serve. If it is allowed to boil, it
will be spoiled, as it will immediately
curdle. <i>Time.</i>—To be stirred over the
fire 3 or 4 minutes; but it must not boil.
<i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for a large
pudding; allow half this quantity for a
moderate-sized one. <i>Seasonable</i> at any
time.</p>


<h3>WINE SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS,
Excellent.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—The yolks of 4 eggs, 1
teaspoonful of flour, 2 oz. of pounded
sugar, 2 oz. of fresh butter, ¼ saltspoonful
of salt, ½ pint of sherry or Madeira.
<i>Mode.</i>—Put the butter and flour into a
saucepan, and stir them over the fire
until the former thickens; then add the
sugar, salt, and wine, and mix these ingredients
well together. Separate the
yolks from the whites of 4 eggs; beat up
the former, and stir them briskly to the
sauce; let it remain over the fire until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
is on the point of simmering; but do not
allow it to boil, or it will instantly curdle.
This sauce is delicious with plum, marrow,
or bread puddings; but should be served
separately, and not poured over the
pudding. <i>Time.</i>—From 5 to 7 minutes
to thicken the butter; about 5 minutes
to stir the sauce over the fire. <i>Average
cost</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> for 7 or 8
persons.</p>


<h3>WINE, to Mull.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—To every pint of wine
allow 1 large cupful of water, sugar, and
spice to taste. <i>Mode.</i>—In making preparations
like the above, it is very difficult
to give the exact proportions of
ingredients like sugar and spice, as what
quantity might suit one person would be
to another quite distasteful. Boil the
spice in the water until the flavour is
extracted, then add the wine and sugar,
and bring the whole to the boiling-point,
when serve with strips of crisp dry toast,
or with biscuits. The spices usually used
for mulled wine are cloves, grated nutmeg,
and cinnamon or mace. Any kind
of wine may be mulled, but port and
claret are those usually selected for the
purpose; and the latter requires a very
large proportion of sugar. The vessel
that the wine is boiled in must be delicately
clean, and should be kept exclusively
for the purpose. Small tin warmers
may be purchased for a trifle, which are
more suitable than saucepans, as, if the
latter are not scrupulously clean, they
will spoil the wine, by imparting to it a
very disagreeable flavour. These warmers
should be used for no other purposes.</p>


<h3>WOODCOCK, Roast.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—Woodcocks; butter,
flour, toast. <i>Mode.</i>—Woodcocks should
not be drawn, as the trails are, by epicures,
considered a great delicacy. Pluck,
and wipe them well outside; truss them
with the legs close to the body, and the
feet pressing upon the thighs; skin the
neck and head, and bring the beak
round under the wing. Place some slices
of toast in the dripping-pan to catch the
trails, allowing a piece of toast for each
bird. Roast before a clear fire from 15
to 25 minutes; keep them well basted,
and flour and froth them nicely. When
done, dish the pieces of toast with the
birds upon them, and pour round a very
little gravy; send some more to table in
a tureen. These are most delicious birds
when well cooked; but they should not
be kept too long: when the feathers
drop, or easily come out, they are fit for
for table. <i>Time.</i>—When liked underdone,
15 to 20 minutes; if liked well
done, allow an extra 5 minutes. <i>Average
cost.</i>—Seldom bought. <i>Sufficient.</i>—2 for
a dish. <i>Seasonable</i> from November to
February.</p>

</div>


<h3>WOODCOCK.</h3>

<p>This bird, like a partridge, may be
carved by cutting it exactly into two
like portions, or made into three helpings,
as described
in carving partridge.
The backbone
is considered
the tit-bit of a
woodcock, and by
many the thigh is
also thought a great delicacy. This bird
is served in the manner advised by
Brillat Savarin, in connection with the
pheasant, viz., on toast which has received
its drippings whilst roasting; and
a piece of this toast should invariably
accompany each plate.</p>

<h3>WOODCOCK, SCOTCH.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—A few slices of hot
buttered toast; allow 1 anchovy to each
slice. For the sauce,—¼ pint of cream,
the yolks of 3 eggs. <i>Mode.</i>—Separate
the yolks from the whites of the eggs;
beat the former, stir to them the cream,
and bring the sauce to the boiling-point,
but do not allow it to boil, or it will
curdle. Have ready some hot buttered
toast, spread with anchovies pounded to
a paste; pour a little of the hot sauce on
the top, and serve very hot and very
quickly. <i>Time.</i>—5 minutes to make the
sauce hot. <i>Sufficient.</i>—Allow ½ slice to
each person. <i>Seasonable</i> at any time.</p>


<h3>YEAST-CAKE.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ lb. of flour, ½ lb. of
butter, ½ pint of milk, 1½ tablespoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
of good yeast, 3 eggs, ¾ lb. of currants,
½ lb. of white moist sugar, 2 oz. of candied
peel. <i>Mode.</i>—Put the milk and butter
into a saucepan, and shake it round over
a fire until the butter is melted, but do
not allow the milk to get very hot. Put
the flour into a basin, stir to it the milk
and butter, the yeast and eggs, which
should be well beaten, and form the
whole into a smooth dough. Let it stand
in a warm place, covered with a cloth, to
rise, and, when sufficiently risen, add the
currants, sugar, and candied peel cut
into thin slices. When all the ingredients
are thoroughly mixed, line 2 moderate-sized
cake-tins with buttered paper,
which should be about six inches higher
than the tin; pour in the mixture, let it
stand to rise again for another ½ hour,
and then bake the cakes in a brisk oven
for about 1½ hour. If the tops of them
become too brown, cover them with
paper until they are done through. A
few drops of essence of lemon, or a little
grated nutmeg, may be added when the
flavour is liked. <i>Time.</i>—From 1¼ to 1½
hour. <i>Average cost</i>, 2<i>s.</i> <i>Sufficient</i> to
make 2 moderate-sized cakes. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>YEAST-DUMPLINGS.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—½ quartern of dough,
boiling water. <i>Mode.</i>—Make a very light
dough as for bread, using to mix it, milk,
instead of water; divide it into 7 or 8
dumplings; plunge them into boiling
water, and boil them for 20 minutes.
Serve the instant they are taken up, as
they spoil directly, by falling and becoming
heavy; and in eating them do
not touch them with a knife, but tear
them apart with two forks. They may
be eaten with meat gravy, or cold butter
and sugar; and if not convenient to make
the dough at home, a little from the
baker’s answers as well, only it must be
placed for a few minutes near the fire, in
a basin with a cloth over it, to let it rise
again before it is made into dumplings.
<i>Time.</i>—20 minutes. <i>Average cost</i>, 4<i>d.</i>
<i>Sufficient</i> for 5 or 6 persons. <i>Seasonable</i>
at any time.</p>


<h3>YEAST, to Make, for Bread.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—1½ oz. of hops, 3 quarts
of water, 1 lb. of bruised malt, ½ pint of
yeast. <i>Mode.</i>—Boil the hops in the
water for 20 minutes; let it stand for
about 5 minutes, then add it to 1 lb. of
bruised malt prepared as for brewing.
Let the mixture stand covered till about
lukewarm; then put in not quite ½ pint
of yeast; keep it warm, and let it work
3 or 4 hours; then put it into small ½-pint
bottles (ginger-beer bottles are the
best for the purpose), cork them well,
and tie them down. The yeast is now
ready for use; it will keep good for a
few weeks, and 1 bottle will be found
sufficient for 18 lbs. of flour. When required
for use, boil 3 lbs. of potatoes
without salt, mash them in the same
water in which they were boiled, and
rub them through a colander. Stir in
about ½ lb. of flour; then put in the
yeast, pour it in the middle of the flour,
and let it stand warm on the hearth all
night, and in the morning let it be quite
warm when it is kneaded. The bottles
of yeast require very careful opening, as
it is generally exceedingly ripe. <i>Time.</i>—20
minutes to boil the hops and water,
the yeast to work 3 or 4 hours. <i>Sufficient.</i>—½
pint sufficient for 18 lbs. of
flour.</p>


<h3>YEAST, Kirkleatham.</h3>

<p><i>Ingredients.</i>—2 oz. of hops, 4 quarts of
water, ½ lb. of flour, ½ pint of yeast.
<i>Mode.</i>—Boil the hops and water for 20
minutes; strain, and mix with the liquid
½ lb. of flour and not quite ½ pint of
yeast. Bottle it up, and tie the corks
down. When wanted for use, boil potatoes
according to the quantity of bread
to be made (about 3 lbs. are sufficient for
about a peck of flour); mash them, add
to them ½ lb. of flour, and mix about
½ pint of the yeast with them; let this
mixture stand all day, and lay the bread
to rise the night before it is wanted.
<i>Time.</i>—20 minutes to boil the hops and
water. <i>Sufficient.</i>—½ pint of this yeast
sufficient for a peck of flour, or rather
more.</p>

<h2>Asque ad Finem.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">HER hand has lost its cunning—the firm, true hand that wrote
these <i>formulæ</i>, and penned the information contained in this
little book. Cold in the silent tomb lie the once nimble, useful
fingers,—now nerveless, unable for anything, and ne’er to do work
more in this world! Exquisite palate, unerring judgment, sound
common sense, refined tastes,—all these had the dear Lady who has
gone ere her youth had scarcely come. But four times seven years
were all she passed in this world; and since the day she became
wedded wife—now nearly nine years past—her greatest, chiefest
aims were to provide for the comfort and pleasure of those she loved
and had around her, and to employ her best faculties for the use
of her sisters, Englishwomen generally. Her surpassing affection
and devotion led her to find her happiness in aiding, with all her
heart and soul, the Husband whom she richly blessed and honoured
with her abounding love.</p>

<p>Her Works speak for themselves; and, although taken from
this world in the very height of health and strength, and in the
early days of womanhood, she felt that satisfaction—so great to all
who strive with good intent and warm will—of knowing herself
regarded with respect and gratitude,</p>

<p>Her labours are ended here; in a purer atmosphere she dwells;
and may be, in the land beyond the skies, she has nobler work to
accomplish. Her plans for the future cannot be wholly carried out:
her Husband knew them all, and will diligently devote himself to
their execution, as far as may be. The remembrance of her wishes,—always
for the private and public welfare,—and the companionship
of her two little boys,—too young to know the virtues of their good
Mother,—this memory, this presence, will nerve the Father, left
alone, to continue to do his duty: in which he will follow the
example of his Wife, for her duty no woman has ever better accomplished
than the late</p>

the other great digests of human knowledge, in consequence
of their high price, are accessible only to a
few. In such works no special provision is made for
supplying short and comprehensive information regarding
individual words, arranged in their alphabetical
order, of the kind most likely to be required by
the great mass of general readers. Mr. Beeton to
some extent enters a new field in devoting a Dictionary
exclusively to proper names in Geography, History,
Biography, Mythology, Bible Knowledge, and

<b>Transcriber’s Notes:</b></div>

<p>Obvious punctuation errors repaired. In the original when soufflé
is in all capitals or small captials, the accent is missing although it often appears
in the recipe itself with the accent. Assuming the editor simply didn’t own
the capital with an acute accent, it has been added to all instances to
make searching more consistent. This was true of all accented characters
such as for Béchamel.</p>

<p>Wherever possible varied hyphenation was eliminated for consistency in searching.
Type-setting was made consistent across recipes. For example all uses of monetary
initials were italicized to follow the form used in the majority.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
